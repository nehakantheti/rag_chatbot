Almost \\nall nations felt the effects last year of global economic uncertainty, including higher \\nenergy and food prices, inflation rates and volatile markets. While all these events \\nand associated instability have serious ramifications on our company, colleagues, \\nclients and countries where we do business, their consequences on the world at large \\n— with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people, escalating tragedy in the Middle \\nEast and the potential restructuring of the global order — are far more important. \\nAs these events unfold, America’s global leadership role is being challenged outside \\nby other nations and inside by our polarized electorate. We need to find ways to put \\naside our differences and work in partnership with other Western nations in the name \\nof democracy. During this time of great crises, uniting to protect our essential \\nfreedoms, including free enterprise, is paramount.

It is important to note that the economy is \\nbeing fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and past stimulus. \\nThere is also a growing need for increased spending as we continue transitioning to  \\na greener economy, restructuring global supply chains, boosting military expenditure \\nand battling rising healthcare costs. This may lead to stickier inflation and higher \\nrates than markets expect. Furthermore, there are downside risks to watch. \\nQuantitative tightening is draining more than $900 billion in liquidity from the system \\nannually — and we have never truly experienced the full effect of quantitative \\ntightening on this scale. Plus the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East \\ncontinue to have the potential to disrupt energy and food markets, migration, and \\nmilitary and economic relationships, in addition to their dreadful human cost. These \\nsignificant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain cautious. \\n2023 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with our firm generating record \\nrevenue for the sixth consecutive year, as well as setting numerous records in each  \\nof our lines of business. We earned revenue in 2023 of $162.4 billion\\n1 and net income \\nof $49.6 billion, with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 21%, reflecting \\nstrong underlying performance across our businesses. We also increased our \\nquarterly common dividend of $1.00 per share to $1.05 per share in the third quarter \\nof 2023 — and again to $1.15 per share in the first quarter of 2024 — while continuing \\nto reinforce our fortress balance sheet. We grew market share in several of our \\nbusinesses and continued to make significant investments in products, people and \\ntechnology while exercising strict risk disciplines. \\nThroughout the year, we demonstrated the power of our investment philosophy and \\nguiding principles, as well as the value of being there for clients — as we always are — \\nin both good times and bad times. The result was continued growth broadly across \\nthe firm. We will highlight a few examples from 2023: Consumer & Community \\nBanking (CCB) extended its #1 leadership positions and grew share year-over-year in \\nretail deposits, credit card sales and credit card outstandings (adding close to 3.6 \\nmillion net new customers to the franchise); the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) \\n1  Represents managed revenue.\\n3'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='maintained its #1 rank in both Investment Banking and Markets and gained more \\nthan 100 basis points of Investment Banking market share; Commercial Banking (CB) \\nadded over 5,000 new relationships (excluding First Republic Bank), roughly doubling \\nthe prior year’s achievement; and Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) saw record \\nclient asset net inflows of $490 billion, over 20% higher than its prior record.\\nIn 2023, we continued to play a forceful and essential role in advancing economic \\ngrowth.

It is clear \\nthat our financial discipline, constant \\ninvestment in innovation and ongoing \\ndevelopment of our people have enabled \\nus to achieve this consistency and com-\\nmitment. In addition, across the firm, we \\nuphold certain steadfast tenets that are \\nworth repeating. \\nFirst, our work has very real human \\nimpact. While JPMorgan Chase stock is \\nowned by large institutions, pension \\nplans, mutual funds and directly by single \\ninvestors, in almost all cases the ultimate \\nbeneficiaries are individuals in our com -\\nmunities. More than 100 million people in \\nthe United States own stocks; many, in \\none way or another, own JPMorgan Chase \\nstock. Frequently, these shareholders are \\nveterans, teachers, police officers, fire -\\nfighters, healthcare workers, retirees, or \\nthose saving for a home, education or \\nretirement. Often, our employees also \\nbank these shareholders, as well as their \\nfamilies and their companies. Your man-\\nagement team goes to work every day \\nrecognizing the enormous responsibility \\nthat we have to all of our shareholders. \\nSecond, shareholder value can be built \\nonly if you maintain a healthy and vibrant \\ncompany, which means doing a good job \\nof taking care of your customers, employ -\\nees and communities. Conversely, how \\ncan you have a healthy company if you \\nneglect any of these stakeholders? As we \\nhave learned over the past few years, \\nthere are myriad ways an institution can \\ndemonstrate its compassion for its \\nemployees and its communities while still \\nstrengthening shareholder value.\\nThird, while we don’t run the company \\nworrying about the stock price in the short \\nrun, in the long run we consider our stock \\nprice a measure of our progress over time. \\nThis progress is a function of continual \\ninvestments in our people, systems and \\nproducts, in good and bad times, to build \\nour capabilities. These important invest-\\nments will also drive our company’s future \\nprospects and position it to grow and \\nprosper for decades. Measured by stock \\nperformance, our progress is exceptional. \\nFor example, whether looking back 10 \\nyears or even farther to 2004, when the \\nJPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger took \\nplace, we have outperformed the Standard \\n& Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard & \\nPoor’s Financials Index. \\nFourth, we are united behind basic princi -\\nples and strategies (you can see the prin -\\nciples for How We Do Business on our \\nwebsite and our Purpose statement  in my \\nletter from last year) that have helped \\nbuild this company and made it thrive. \\nThese allow us to maintain a fortress bal -\\nance sheet, constantly invest and nurture \\ntalent, fully satisfy regulators, continually \\nimprove risk, governance and controls, \\nand serve customers and clients while \\nlifting up communities worldwide. This \\nphilosophy is embedded in our company \\nculture and influences nearly every role \\nin the firm. \\nFifth, we strive to build enduring busi-\\nnesses, which rely on and benefit from one \\nanother, but we are not a conglomerate. \\nThis structure helps generate our superior \\nreturns. Nonetheless, despite our best \\nefforts, the walls that protect this com-\\npany are not particularly high — and we \\nface extraordinary competition. I have \\nwritten about this reality extensively in the \\npast and cover it again in this letter. We \\nrecognize our strengths and vulnerabili-\\nties, and we play our hand as best we can.\\nSixth, and this is the new one, we must be \\na source of strength, particularly in tough \\ntimes, for our clients and the countries in \\nwhich we operate. We must take seriously \\nour role as one of the guardians of the \\nworld’s financial systems.\\nSeventh, we operate with a very important \\nsilent partner — the U.S. government — \\nnoting as my friend Warren Buffett points \\nout that his company’s success is predi-\\ncated upon the extraordinary conditions \\nour country creates. He is right to say to \\nhis shareholders that when they see the \\nAmerican flag, they all should say thank \\nyou. We should, too. JPMorgan Chase is a \\nhealthy and thriving company, and we \\nalways want to give back and pay our fair \\nshare. We do pay our fair share — and we \\nwant it to be spent well and have the \\ngreatest impact. To give you an idea of \\nwhere our taxes and fees go: In the last 10 \\nyears, we paid more than $46 billion in \\nfederal, state and local taxes in the United \\nStates and over $22 billion in taxes outside \\nof the United States. Additionally, we paid \\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \\nover $10 billion so that it has the resources \\nto cover failure in the American banking \\nsector. Our partner — the federal govern-\\nment — also imposes significant regula-\\ntions upon us, and it is imperative that we \\nmeet all legal and regulatory require-\\nments imposed on our company. \\nEighth and finally, we know the founda-\\ntion of our success rests with our people. \\nThey are the front line, both individually \\nand as teams, serving our customers and \\ncommunities, building the technology, \\nmaking the strategic decisions, managing \\nthe risks, determining our investments \\nand driving innovation. However you view \\nthe world — its complexity, risks and \\nopportunities — a company’s prosperity \\nrequires a great team of people with \\nguts, brains, integrity, enormous capabili-\\nties and high standards of professional \\nexcellence to ensure its ongoing success .\\n5'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='2000 \\nJamie Dimon joins Bank \\nOne as Chairman and \\nCEO\\nChase Manhattan buys \\nJ.P.

Morgan Chase\\nBy 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase already represented the consolidation of four of the 10 \\nlargest U.S. banks from 1990: The Chase Manhattan Corp., Manufacturers Hanover, \\nChemical Banking Corp. and, most recently, J.P. Morgan & Company. And some of their \\npredecessor companies stretched back into the 1800s, one even into the late 1700s.\\nBank One\\nBank One had been even busier on the acquisition front, especially across the United \\nStates. By 1998, then Banc One had more than 1,300 branches in 12 states when it \\nannounced a merger with First Chicago NBD, a Chicago-based bank created just  \\nthree years earlier by the merger of First Chicago and Detroit-based NBD. Now \\nheadquartered in Chicago, the new Bank One became the largest bank in the \\nMidwest, second largest among credit card companies and fourth largest in the \\nUnited States. But the merger didn’t go as planned, with Bank One issuing three \\ndifferent earnings warnings. In March 2000, Bank One reached outside its executive \\nranks, and my tenure began as Chairman and CEO, working to overhaul the company \\nand help bring it back to profitability and growth. \\nThe story begins ... A merger 20 years ago helped transform two giant banks\\nFast forward to 2003, and another wave of consolidation was well underway in U.S. \\nbanking. Most of the nation’s larger banks were trying to position themselves to be an \\n“endgame winner.” In the biggest deal, Bank of America agreed to buy FleetBoston \\nFinancial Corp. for more than $40 billion. Those two banks — already amalgamations \\nof several predecessor companies — touted the breadth of their combined retail \\nbranch network.\\n7'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 9, 'page_label': '8'}, page_content='But they were hardly alone. In 2003, some 215 deals were announced among  \\nU.S. commercial banks and bank holding companies for a total value of $66 billion, \\naccording to Thomson Financial, which tracks merger data.\\nIn July 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One merged — as part of a 225-year \\njourney — to form this exceptional company of ours: JPMorgan Chase. At its merger  \\nin 2004, the combined bank was the fourth largest bank in the world by market \\ncapitalization. But with patient groundwork over the years — fixing systems and \\nupgrading technology, managing the notable acquisitions of Bear Stearns and \\nWashington Mutual (WaMu) and continuing to reinvest, including in our talent —  \\nwe have made our company an endgame winner. \\nIn earlier years, banks worried about their survival. While the past two decades have \\nbrought some virtually unprecedented challenges, including the great financial crisis \\nand a pandemic followed by a global shutdown, they did not stop us from \\naccomplishing extraordinary things. Our bank has now emerged as the #1 bank by \\nmarket capitalization. \\nEach of our businesses is among the best in the world, with increased market share, \\nstrong financial results and an unwavering focus on serving our clients, communities \\nand shareholders with distinction and dedication. The strengths that are embedded in \\nJPMorgan Chase — the knowledge and cohesiveness of our people, our long-standing \\nclient relationships, our technology and product capabilities, our presence in more \\nthan 100 countries and our unquestionable fortress balance sheet — would be hard to \\nreplicate. Crucially, the strength of our company has allowed us to always be there for \\nclients, governments and communities — in good times and in bad times — and this \\nstrength has enabled us to continually invest in building our businesses for the future.\\nYou can see from the following charts what gains and improvements we have \\nachieved along the way. \\n8'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 10, 'page_label': '9'}, page_content='9\\n24_JD_earnings_diluted_03\\nDRAFT 3.14.24–TYPESET; 4/4/24; v.24_JD_earnings_diluted_03\\nNet income    Diluted earnings per share (EPS)    Return on tangible common equity (ROTCE)\\n \\n           \\n2023202220212020201920182017201620152014201320122011201020092008200720062005\\n$8.5\\n$15.4\\n$17.4\\n$19.0\\n$21.3\\n$17.9\\n$21.7\\n$24.4\\n$14.4\\n$24.7 $24.4\\n$26.9\\n$38.4\\n$36.4\\n$37.7\\n$49.6$48.3\\n$32.5\\n15%\\n24%\\n22%\\n6%\\n10% 15%15%\\n15%\\n11% 13%\\n13% 12%\\n17%\\n19%\\n14%\\n23%\\n18%\\n21%\\n13%\\n$4.00 $4.33\\n$1.35\\n$2.26\\n$3.96\\n$4.48\\n$5.19 \\n$4.34 \\n$5.29 \\n$6.00\\n$6.31\\n$10.72\\n$15.36\\n$12.09\\n$16.23\\n$8.88\\n$9.00\\n$6.19\\n$2.35 $5.6\\n$11.7\\n$29.1\\n$39.1\\n1 Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses accounting guidance.

First and \\nforemost may well be the impact of artificial intel -\\nligence (AI).\\nWhile we do not know the full effect or the precise \\nrate at which AI will change our business — or how \\nit will affect society at large — we are completely \\nconvinced the consequences will be extraordinary \\nand possibly as transformational as some of the \\nmajor technological inventions of the past several \\nhundred years: Think the printing press, the steam \\nengine, electricity, computing and the Internet, \\namong others.\\nTHE CRITICAL IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL \\nINTELLIGENCE \\nSince the firm first started using AI over a decade \\nago, and its first mention in my 2017 letter to \\nshareholders, we have grown our AI organization \\nmaterially. It now includes more than 2,000 AI/\\nmachine learning (ML) experts and data scientists. \\nWe continue to attract some of the best and \\nbrightest in this space and have an exceptional \\nfirmwide AI/ML and Research department with \\ndeep expertise.\\nWe have been actively using predictive AI and ML \\nfor years — and now have over 400 use cases in \\nproduction in areas such as marketing, fraud and \\nrisk — and they are increasingly driving real busi -\\nness value across our businesses and functions. \\nWe’re also exploring the potential that generative \\nAI (GenAI) can unlock across a range of domains, \\nmost notably in software engineering, customer \\nservice and operations, as well as in general \\nemployee productivity. In the future, we envision \\nGenAI helping us reimagine entire business work -\\nflows. We will continue to experiment with these  \\nAI and ML capabilities and implement solutions in \\na safe, responsible way.\\nWhile we are investing more money in our AI capa -\\nbilities, many of these projects pay for themselves. \\nOver time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the \\npotential to augment virtually every job, as well as \\nimpact our workforce composition. It may reduce \\ncertain job categories or roles, but it may create \\nothers as well. As we have in the past, we will \\naggressively retrain and redeploy our talent to \\nmake sure we are taking care of our employees  \\nif they are affected by this trend. \\nFinally, as a global leader across businesses and \\nregions, we have large amounts of extraordinarily \\nrich data that, together with AI, can fuel better \\ninsights and help us improve how we manage risk \\nand serve our customers. In addition to making \\nsure our data is high quality and easily accessible, \\nwe need to complete the migration of our analyti -\\ncal data estate to the public cloud. These new data \\nplatforms offer high-performance compute power, \\nwhich will unlock our ability to use our data in \\nways that are hard to contemplate today.\\nRecognizing the importance of AI to our \\nbusiness, we created a new position called \\nChief Data & Analytics Officer that sits on our \\nOperating Committee. \\nElevating this new role to the Operating Committee \\nlevel — reporting directly to Daniel Pinto and me — \\nreflects how critical this function will be going for-\\nward and how seriously we expect AI to influence \\nour business.

The cloud offers many benefits: \\n1) it accelerates the speed of delivery of new ser-\\nvices; 2) it simultaneously reduces the cost of com -\\npute power and enables, when needed, an extraor -\\ndinary amount of compute capability — called \\nburst computing; 3) it provides that compute capa -\\nbility across all of our data; and 4) it allows us to \\nbe able to constantly and quickly adopt new tech -\\nnologies because updated cloud services are con -\\ntinually being added — more so in the public cloud, \\nwhere we benefit from the innovation that all \\ncloud providers create, than in the private cloud, \\nwhere innovation is only our own. \\nOf course, we are learning a lot along the way.  \\nFor example, we know we should carefully pick \\nwhich applications and which data go to the public \\ncloud versus the private cloud because of the \\nexpense, security and capabilities required. In \\naddition, it is critical that we eventually use multi -\\nple clouds to avoid lock-in. And we intend to main -\\ntain our own expertise so that we’re never reliant \\non the expertise of others even if that requires \\nadditional money.\\nWe invested approximately $2 billion to build four \\nnew, modern, private cloud-based, highly reliable \\nand efficient data centers in the United States (we \\nhave 32 data centers globally). To date, about 50% \\nof our applications run a large part of their pro -\\ncessing in the public or private cloud. Approxi -\\nmately 70% of our data is now running in the pub-\\nlic or private cloud. By the end of 2024, we aim to \\nhave 70% of applications and 75% of data moved \\nto the public or private cloud. The new data cen -\\nters are around 30% more efficient than our exist -\\ning legacy data centers. Going to the public cloud \\ncan provide 30% additional efficiency if done cor -\\nrectly (efficiency improves when your data and \\napplications have been modified, or “refactored,” \\nto enable new cloud services). We have been con -\\nstantly updating most of our global data centers, \\nand by the end of this year, we can start closing \\nsome that are larger, older and less efficient. \\nACQUIRING FIRST REPUBLIC BANK AND \\nITS CUSTOMERS\\nThe purchase of First Republic Bank was not some -\\nthing that we would have done just for ourselves. \\nBut the regulators relied on us to step forward (we \\nworked hand in hand with the Federal Reserve, the \\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and \\nthe U.S. Treasury), and the purchase of First \\nRepublic helped stabilize and strengthen the U.S. \\nfinancial system in a time of crisis.\\nThe acquisition of a major company entails a lot of \\ncomplexity. People tend to focus on the financial \\nand economic outcomes, which is a reasonable \\nthing to do. And in the case of First Republic,  \\nthe numbers look rather good. We recorded an \\naccounting gain of $3 billion on the purchase, and \\nwe told the world we expected to add more than \\n$500 million to earnings annually, which we now \\nbelieve will be closer to $2 billion. However, these \\nresults mask some of the true costs. First, approxi -\\nmately one-third of the incremental earning was \\nsimply deploying excess capital and liquidity, which \\ndoesn’t require purchasing a $300 billion bank — \\nwe simply could have bought $300 billion of \\nassets.

And I have written in the \\npast about high levels of debt, fiscal stimulus, \\nongoing deficit spending and the unknown effects \\nof quantitative tightening (which I am more wor-\\nried about than most) so I won’t repeat those \\nviews here. However, the impacts of these geopo -\\nlitical and economic forces are large and some -\\nwhat unprecedented; they may not be fully under-\\nstood until they have completely played out over \\nmultiple years. In any case, JPMorgan Chase must \\nbe prepared for the various potential impacts and \\noutcomes on our company and our people.\\nWe remain wary of economic prognosticating. \\nWhile all companies essentially budget on a base \\ncase forecast, we are very careful not to run  our \\nbusiness that way. Instead, we look at a range of \\npotential outcomes for which we need to be pre -\\npared. Geopolitical and economic forces have an \\nunpredictable timetable — they may unfold over \\nmonths, or years, and are nearly impossible to put \\ninto a one-year forecast. They also have an unpre -\\ndictable interplay: For example, the geopolitical \\nsituation may end up having virtually no effect on \\nthe world’s economy or it could potentially be its \\ndeterminative factor. \\nWe have ongoing concerns about persistent \\ninflationary pressures and consider a wide \\nrange of outcomes to manage interest rate \\nexposure and other business risks. \\nMany key economic indicators today continue  \\nto be good and possibly improving, including  \\ninflation. But when looking ahead to tomorrow , \\nconditions that will affect the future should be  \\nconsidered. For example, there seems to be a large \\nnumber of persistent inflationary pressures, which \\nmay likely continue. All of the following factors \\nappear to be inflationary: ongoing fiscal spending, \\nremilitarization of the world, restructuring of \\nglobal trade, capital needs of the new green econ -\\nomy, and possibly higher energy costs in the future \\n(even though there currently is an oversupply of \\ngas and plentiful spare capacity in oil) due to a lack \\nof needed investment in the energy infrastructure. \\nIn the past, fiscal deficits did not seem to be \\nclosely related to inflation. In the 1970s and early \\n1980s, there was a general understanding that \\ninflation was driven by “guns and butter”; i.e.,  \\nfiscal deficits and the increase to the money  \\nsupply, both partially driven by the Vietnam War, \\nled to increased inflation, which went over 10%. \\nThe deficits today are even larger and occurring in \\nboom times — not as the result of a recession — \\nand they have been supported by quantitative  \\neasing, which was never done before the great \\nfinancial crisis. Quantitative easing is a form of \\nincreasing the money supply (though it has many \\noffsets). I remain more concerned about quantita -\\ntive easing than most, and its reversal, which has \\nnever been done before at this scale. \\nUPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY\\n19'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 21, 'page_label': '20'}, page_content='Equity values, by most measures, are at the high \\nend of the valuation range, and credit spreads are \\nextremely tight. These markets seem to be pricing \\nin at a 70% to 80% chance of a soft landing — \\nmodest growth along with declining inflation and \\ninterest rates. I believe the odds are a lot lower \\nthan that. In the meantime, there seems to be an \\nenormous focus, too much so, on monthly inflation \\ndata and modest changes to interest rates. But the \\ndie may be cast — interest rates looking out a year \\nor two may be predetermined by all of the factors  \\nI mentioned above. Small changes in interest rates \\ntoday may have less impact on inflation in the \\nfuture than many people believe.\\nTherefore, we are prepared for a very broad range \\nof interest rates, from 2% to 8% or even more, \\nwith equally wide-ranging economic outcomes — \\nfrom strong economic growth with moderate infla -\\ntion (in this case, higher interest rates would result \\nfrom higher demand for capital) to a recession \\nwith inflation; i.e., stagflation. Economically, the \\nworst-case scenario would be stagflation, which \\nwould not only come with higher interest rates but \\nalso with higher credit losses, lower business  \\nvolumes and more difficult markets. Under these \\nmany different scenarios, our company would  \\ncontinue to perform at least okay. Importantly, \\nbeing prepared means we can continue to help our \\nclients no matter what the future portends. \\nThe mini banking crisis of 2023 is over, but \\nbeware of higher rates and recession — not \\njust for banks but for the whole economy.\\nWhen we purchased First Republic in May 2023  \\nfollowing the failure of two other regional banks, \\nSilicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, we \\nthought that the current banking crisis was over. \\nOnly these three banks were offsides in having  \\nthe toxic combination of extreme interest rate \\nexposure, large unrealized losses in the \\nheld-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio and highly  \\nconcentrated deposits. Most of the other regional \\nbanks did not have these problems. However, we \\nstipulated that the crisis was over provided that \\ninterest rates didn’t go up dramatically and we \\ndidn’t experience a serious recession. If long-end \\nrates go up over 6% and this increase is accompa-\\nnied by a recession, there will be plenty of stress — \\nnot just in the banking system but with leveraged \\ncompanies and others. Remember, a simple 2  \\npercentage point increase in rates essentially \\nreduced the value of most financial assets by 20%, \\nand certain real estate assets, specifically office \\nreal estate, may be worth even less due to the \\neffects of recession and higher vacancies. Also \\nremember that credit spreads tend to widen, \\nsometimes dramatically, in a recession. \\nFinally, we should also consider that rates have \\nbeen extremely low for a long time — it’s hard to \\nknow how many investors and companies are truly \\nprepared for a higher rate environment. \\nWe seek to be engaged globally and carefully \\nmanage complex countries and geopolitical \\nissues.\\nJPMorgan Chase does business in more than 100 \\ncountries, and we have people on the ground in \\nover 60 countries. In almost all those locations, we \\ndo research on their economy, their markets and \\ntheir companies; we bank their government insti -\\ntutions and their companies; and we bank multina -\\ntional corporations, including the U.S. multina -\\ntional corporations within their borders. This is a \\ncritical role — not only in helping those countries \\ngrow and improve but also in expanding the global \\neconomy. \\nMany of these countries are quite complex with dif-\\nferent laws, customs and regulations.

And \\nwhen it does, we salute.

Think of trade \\nrules, sanctions, anti-money laundering and the \\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act, among others. By \\nand large, these things help improve those coun -\\ntries.

This dialogue is part of the nor -\\nmal course of business but it is also part of build -\\ning trust and putting down roots in a community. \\nWe believe that companies, and banks in particu -\\nlar, must earn the trust of the communities and \\ncountries in which they operate. We believe — and \\nwe are unashamed about this — that it is our obliga-\\ntion to help lift up the communities and countries in \\nwhich we do business. We believe that doing so \\nenhances business and the general economic \\nwell-being of those communities and countries and \\nalso enhances long-term shareholder value. JPMor-\\ngan Chase thrives when communities thrive. \\nThis approach is integral to what we do, in great \\nscale, around the world — and it works. We are \\nquite clear that whether our efforts are inspired by \\nthe goodness of our hearts (as philanthropy or \\nventure-type investing) or good business, we try  \\nto measure the actual outcomes . \\nIt’s also interesting to point out that many of our \\nefforts were spawned from our work around \\nAdvancing Black Pathways, Military and Veterans \\nAffairs, and our work in Detroit. While we’ve \\nbanked Detroit for more than 90 years, our $200 \\nmillion investment in its economic recovery over \\nthe last decade demonstrated that investing in \\ncommunities is a smart business strategy. We are \\none of the largest banks in Detroit, from consumer \\nbanking to investment banking, and it’s quite clear \\nthat not only did our efforts help Detroit, but they \\nalso helped us gain market share. The extent of \\nDetroit’s remarkable recovery was recently high -\\nlighted when Moody’s upgraded the city’s credit \\nrating to investment grade — an extraordinary \\nachievement just over 10 years after the city filed \\nthe largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.\\nFor JPMorgan Chase, Detroit was an incubator for \\ndeveloping models that help us hone how we \\ndeploy our business resources, philanthropic capi -\\ntal, skilled volunteerism, and low-cost loans and \\nequity investments, as well as how we identify top \\ntalent to drive successful business and societal \\nimprovements. I hope that, as shareholders, you \\nare proud of our focus on promoting opportunity \\nfor all, both within and outside our organization, \\nwhich includes economic opportunity. Some of our \\ninitiatives are listed below. \\n• Business Resource Groups.  To deepen our cul-\\nture of inclusion in the workplace, we have 10 \\nBusiness Resource Groups (BRG) across the com -\\npany to connect more than 160,000 participat -\\ning employees around common interests, as well \\nas to foster networking and camaraderie. \\nGroups welcome anyone — allies and those with \\nshared affinities alike. For example, some of our \\nlargest BRGs are Access Ability (employees with \\ndisabilities and caregivers), Adelante (Hispanic \\nand Latino employees), BOLD (Black employees), \\nNextGen (early career professionals), PRIDE \\n(LGBTQ+ employees) and Women on the Move. \\nUPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY\\n21'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 23, 'page_label': '22'}, page_content='• Women on the Move. At JPMorgan Chase, they \\nsure are! Women represent 28% of our firm’s \\nsenior leadership globally. In fact, our major \\nlines of business — CCB, AWM and CIB, which \\nwould be among Fortune 1000 companies on \\ntheir own — are all run by women (one with a \\nco-head who is male). More than 10 years ago, a \\nhandful of senior women at the company, on \\ntheir own, started this global, firmwide, inter -\\nnally focused organization called Women on the \\nMove.

The Women on the Move \\nBRG has more than 70,000 employees globally. \\n• Advancing Black Pathways. This comprehensive \\nprogram, which just reached the five-year mark, \\nfocuses on strengthening the economic founda -\\ntion of Black communities because we know that \\nopportunity is not always created equally. The \\nprogram does so by, among other accomplish -\\nments, helping to diversify our talent pipeline, \\nproviding opportunities for Black individuals to \\nenter the workforce and gain valuable experi-\\nence, and investing in the financial success of \\nBlack Americans through a focus on financial \\nhealth, homeownership and entrepreneurship. \\nAn important part of the program’s work is \\nachieved through our investment in Historically \\nBlack Colleges and Universities (HBCU). We now \\npartner with 18 schools across the United States \\nto boost recruitment connections, expand \\ncareer pathways for Black students and other \\nstudents, and support their long-term develop -\\nment and financial health. As a measure of the \\nprogram’s success, in four years we have made \\nnearly 400 hires into summer and full-time  \\nanalyst and associate roles at the firm.\\n• Military and Veterans Affairs. This firmwide \\neffort sponsors recruitment, mentorship and \\ndevelopment programs to support the military \\nmembers and veterans working at JPMorgan \\nChase. Back in 2011, we joined with 10 other com-\\npanies to launch the Veteran Jobs Mission (VJM), \\nwhose membership has since grown to more than \\n300 companies representing various industries \\nacross the United States and has hired over \\n900,000 veterans and military spouses. In 2023, \\nVJM announced the creation of its Advisory \\nBoard, which is composed of 14 corporate lead-\\ners, to provide strategic direction and oversight \\nof VJM as it continues to expand its commitment \\nto support economic opportunities for veterans \\nand military spouses, including its goal to hire 2 \\nmillion veterans and 200,000 military spouses by \\n2030. JPMorgan Chase alone has hired in excess \\nof 18,000 veterans since 2011 and currently \\nemploys more than 3,100 military spouses.\\n• Creating opportunity for people with disabili -\\nties. The firm’s Office of Disability Inclusion  \\ncontinues to lead strategy and initiatives aimed \\nat advancing economic opportunity for people \\nwith disabilities. In 2023, we joined lawmakers \\nand business leaders in Washington, D.C., to \\nshow support for passage of the Supplemental \\nSecurity Income (SSI) Savings Penalty  \\nElimination Act. Modernizing the SSI program, \\nby updating asset limits for the first time in \\nnearly 40 years, would allow millions of people \\nwith disabilities who receive SSI benefits the \\nopportunity to build their savings without put -\\nting their essential benefits at risk. We also  \\nprovided business coaching to more than 370 \\nentrepreneurs with disabilities. \\n• Virtual call centers. When we sought to expand \\nour customer service specialists program across \\nthe United States, we turned to Detroit, launch -\\ning our first virtual call center in 2022. Invest -\\nments in Detroit’s workforce development  \\ninfrastructure helped us hire 90 virtual cus -\\ntomer service specialists for a program that  \\nhas outperformed many of our traditional call \\ncenters around the world. Following this suc-\\ncess, we expanded our hiring efforts and this \\nvirtual program to Baltimore to create new jobs \\nthat jump-start careers. And now we’re evaluat -\\ning the possibility of expanding even further. \\nUPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY\\n22'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 24, 'page_label': '23'}, page_content='• Entrepreneurs of Color Fund. A critical chal -\\nlenge we have seen in so many communities is \\nthat traditional lending standards render too \\nmany entrepreneurs — particularly entrepre -\\nneurs of color and those serving these commu -\\nnities — ineligible for credit. In response, we \\nhelped launch the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund \\n(EOCF) in Detroit, a lending program designed to \\nhelp aspiring small business owners gain access \\nto critical resources needed for growth that are \\noften not equitably available — capital, technical \\nassistance and mentorship, among others. \\nThese challenges aren’t unique to Detroit so we \\nworked with community development financial \\ninstitutions to replicate the EOCF program in  \\n10 markets across the United States in 2023, \\ndeploying more than 2,900 loans and $176  \\nmillion in capital to underserved entrepreneurs \\nacross the country. \\n• Senior business consultants. To help entrepre -\\nneurs and small businesses make the transition \\nfrom community lending to accessing capital \\nfrom traditional financial institutions, we created  \\na new job — senior business consultant — to  \\nprovide support. Senior business consultants in \\nbranches that focus on underserved communi -\\nties offer coaching and help business owners \\nwith everything from navigating access to credit \\nto managing cash flow to generating effective \\nmarketing. Since 2020, these consultants have \\nmentored more than 5,500 business owners, \\nhelping them improve their operations, grow \\nrevenue and network with others in the local \\nbusiness community. \\n• AdvancingCities. The organizing principles that \\ndefine the business and community investments \\nwe make and how we best achieve an overall \\nimpact in local economies were heavily influ -\\nenced by our experience in Detroit. Seeing \\nDetroit’s comeback begin to take shape several \\nyears ago, we created Advancing Cities to repli-\\ncate this model for large-scale investments to \\nother cities around the world. From San Fran -\\ncisco to Paris to Greater Washington, D.C., we’ve \\napplied what we learned in Detroit to communi -\\nties where conditions are opportune for success \\nand require deeper investments — where com -\\nmunity, civic and business leaders have come \\ntogether to solve problems and get results. \\n• JPMorgan Chase Service Corps . Ten years ago, \\nwe launched the JPMorgan Chase Service Corps \\nto strengthen the capacity-building of nonprofit \\npartners. We brought employees from around \\nthe world to Detroit to assist with its recovery — \\nfrom creating a scoring model for a nonprofit to \\nhelping prioritize neighborhoods for develop -\\nment funding to devising an implementation \\nplan for an integrated talent management  \\nsystem. Since that time, the Service Corps has \\nexpanded, with more than 1,500 JPMorgan \\nChase employees contributing 100,000 hours  \\nto support over 300 nonprofits globally. \\n• Community Centers/Branches and Community \\nManagers. A local bank branch, especially in a \\nlow-income neighborhood, can be successful \\nonly when it fits the community’s needs. That is \\nwhy over the last several years we have shifted \\nour approach to how we offer access to financial \\nhealth education, as well as low-cost products \\nand services to help build wealth. Since 2019,  \\nwe have opened 16 Community Center branches, \\noften in areas with larger Black, Hispanic or \\nLatino populations, and have plans to open \\nthree more by the end of 2024. These branches \\nhave more space to host grassroots community \\nevents, small business mentoring sessions and \\nfinancial health seminars, which have been \\nwell-attended — to date, over 400,000 people \\nhave taken advantage of the financial education \\nseminars. In each of these Community Center \\nbranches, we hired a Community Manager (who \\nacts as a local ambassador) to build relation -\\nships with community leaders, nonprofits and \\nsmall businesses. The Community Manager  \\nconcept and practice have become so successful \\nthat we have also placed these managers in \\nmany of our traditional branches in underserved \\ncommunities.

We are proud \\nto be the only bank with branches in all 48 con -\\ntiguous states, which include many rural com -\\nmunities. Nearly 17 million consumers living in \\nrural areas hold over $100 billion in deposits \\nwith us and $175 billion in loans. We are also a \\nleading wholesale lender in these communities, \\nhelping to fuel local economies through relation -\\nships with local companies, governments, hospi -\\ntals and universities. Since 2019, we have made \\nmaterial progress in extending our footprint to \\nreach more rural Americans, including expand -\\ning our branch network into 13 new states with \\nlarge rural populations. Now we are raising the \\nbar. With our new strategy, we have a goal to \\nhave a branch available to serve 50% of a state’s \\npopulation within an acceptable driving dis-\\ntance, including in heavily rural states such as \\nAlabama and Iowa. This focus is part  of our \\nrecently announced plan to build an additional \\n500 branches and hire 3,500 employees over \\nthe next three years. Through this expansion,  \\nwe will partner across lines of business and our \\nCorporate Responsibility organization to help \\nadvance inclusive economic growth and bring \\nthe full force of the firm to America’s heartland. \\nWe’ve nearly completed our five-year, $30 \\nbillion Racial Equity Commitment — it will now \\nbecome a permanent part of our business. \\nWhat began in 2020 as a five-year, $30 billion  \\ncommitment is now transforming into a consistent \\nbusiness practice for our lines of business in  \\nsupport of Black, Hispanic, Latino and other  \\nunderserved communities. By the end of 2023,  \\nwe reported over $30 billion in progress toward \\nour original goal. However, our focus is not on  \\nhow much money is deployed — but on long-term \\nimpact and outcomes.

Through our  \\nAffordable Housing Preservation program, we \\napproved program funding to date of approxi-\\nmately $21 billion in loans to incentivize the \\npreservation of over 190,000 affordable housing \\nrental units across the United States. Addition -\\nally, we financed approximately $5 billion for the \\nconstruction and rehabilitation of affordable \\nrental housing. \\n• Homeownership. In 2023, we expanded our \\n$5,000 Chase Homebuyer Grant program to \\ninclude over 15,000 majority Black, Hispanic and \\nLatino communities — and in January 2024, we \\nincreased our grant amount to $7,500 in select \\nmarkets. Since our grant program began in \\n2021, we have provided about 8,600 grants \\ntotaling $43 million.

The goal was to explore various aspects of the \\nclimate challenge and try to devise effective solutions that \\ncould help lead to meaningful progress. The climate challenge \\nis immense and complex. Addressing it requires more than \\nmaking simplistic statements and rules; rather, energy \\nsystems and global supply chains need to be transformed \\nacross virtually all industries. And there is also a deep need \\nfor new research and development. Energy systems and \\nsupply chains provide the foundation of the global economy \\nand must be treated with care.\\nAt the same time, the opportunity here is immense. The \\ninvestment required to meet climate goals — estimated at over \\n$5 trillion annually — could generate economywide growth and \\nopportunity at a scale the world has not seen since the \\nIndustrial Revolution.\\nThe task for industry, policymakers and finance is to help \\nformulate solutions that support the transition to a low-carbon \\neconomy, balancing affordable, reliable access to energy with \\ngenerating economic growth.\\nTo find a way forward, we sought input from diverse \\nstakeholders in pursuit of a North Star. In Scottsdale and in \\ndiscussions with clients across industries about what’s needed \\nto achieve a low-carbon economy, these five action steps and \\nreforms were top of mind:\\n • Supportive government policy and leadership to advance \\nthe transition. Policy that promotes favorable economic \\nconditions to make the transition viable is a critical first step \\nfor clients. This includes government leadership via \\nmandates, incentives or subsidies to support jobs and \\ninvestment in the transition; actions on permitting and \\ninterconnection reform; and regulatory clarity and \\ncertainty, especially around long-term investments. As one \\nvital example, current grid infrastructure is insufficient to \\naccommodate the growth in renewables. \\n • Public/private partnerships in scaling bankable projects. \\nScaling investments needs to happen both for commercially \\nproven technologies (e.g., wind and solar) and for emerging \\ntechnologies (e.g., green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel \\nand carbon capture). Developing “bankable” clean energy \\nprojects will require the application of smart financial tools, \\nas well as further policy support. It will take public/private \\npartnerships and innovation to create catalytic forms of \\ncapital that can step into these gaps, absorb first-mover  \\nrisks and provide the necessary funding.  The cost of capital  \\nis too high for some companies — and public funds ought  \\nto be deployed in a smart way that effectively attracts  \\nprivate capital. \\n • Public education and engagement. Without question, clients \\ntold us that public commitment to and investment in energy-\\nrelated infrastructure is one of the most important parts of \\ncombating the climate crisis and running their businesses. \\nSupporting the buildout of energy-related infrastructure with \\nspeed and scale is critical. Public acceptance of building and \\nadvancing the infrastructure needed to meet climate goals is \\nat the heart of progress. While the energy transition is poised \\nto deliver benefits to communities across the world, securing \\nacceptance and support to build clean energy infrastructure \\nat scale is challenging. Access to job-creating renewable \\nenergy projects can help rural communities thrive by \\nadvancing local economies. Ensuring public support and \\nsocial license to operate requires better engagement \\nstrategies, including widespread stakeholder education about \\nthe benefits of these technologies for local communities. \\n • Communication about concrete successes. Across \\nindustries, market participants need to do a better job of \\ncelebrating and championing concrete successes and \\ntangible milestones. This includes highlighting success \\nstories around emerging technologies and the complex \\nnature of the carbon transition. Stakeholders also should \\nbetter convey the benefits of clean energy — across all \\ntechnologies — to help combat misinformation and foster a \\nmore informed dialogue.\\nUPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY\\n26'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 28, 'page_label': '27'}, page_content='• Work skills training.

But it’s been quite a while since then, and \\nwe’re still debating some very basic issues. It’s \\ntime to take a serious, hard, honest look at what \\nhas been done and what can be improved. \\nIt’s good to remember that the United States has \\nthe best financial system in the world, with diversi -\\nfied, deep and experienced institutions, from \\nbanks, pension plans, hedge funds and private \\nequity to individual investors. It has healthy public \\nand private markets, transparency, rule of law and \\ndeep research. The best banking system in the \\nworld is a critical part of this, and, integrated with \\nthe overall financial system, is foundational to the \\nproper allocation of capital, innovation and the \\nfueling of America’s growth engine. \\nThis is not about JPMorgan Chase — we believe we \\ncan manage through whatever is thrown our way. \\nThis is about the impact on all parts of the system \\n— from smaller banks to larger regional banks that \\nmay not have the resources to handle all of these \\nregulatory requirements. It’s also about the effect \\non the financial markets and the economy from the \\nrapidly growing shadow banking system, as well as \\nthe ultimate impact on the customers, clients and \\ncommunities we serve. This is about what’s right \\nfor the system. \\nThe banking and financial system is \\ninnovative, dynamic and constantly changing.\\nThe banking system is not static: There are startup \\nbanks, mergers, successful upstarts and fintech \\nbanks, and even Apple, which effectively acts as a \\nbank — it holds money, moves money, lends money \\nand so on. Nonbanks are competing with tradi -\\ntional banks, and, in general, this dynamism and \\nchurn are good for innovation and invention — with \\nsuccess and failure simply part of the robust pro -\\ncess. Innovation runs across payments systems, \\nbudgeting, digital access, product extensions, risk \\nand fraud prevention, and other services. Different \\ninstitutions play different roles, and, importantly, \\nsmall banks and big banks serve completely differ -\\nent strategic functions. Large banks bank multina -\\ntional corporations around the world, make \\nhealthy markets, and wield technology and a prod -\\nuct set that are the best in the world. A small bank \\nsimply cannot bank these same multinational gov -\\nernments and safely move the amount of money \\nand securities that large banks do. Regional and \\ncommunity banks have exceptional local knowl -\\nedge and presence and are critical in serving  \\nthousands of towns and certain geographies. \\nIt is also important to recognize that the banking \\nsystem as we know it is shrinking relative to pri -\\nvate markets and fintech, which are growing and \\nbecoming increasingly competitive. And remember \\nthat many of these new players do not have the \\nsame transparency or need to abide by the exten -\\nsive rules and regulations as traditional banks, \\neven if they offer similar products — this often \\ngives them significant advantage. \\nTo deal with this fluid environment, banks of all \\nsizes develop their own strategies, whether to  \\nspecialize, expand geographically or embark on \\nmergers and acquisitions. There are certain banking \\nservices where economies of scale are a competitive \\nadvantage, but not all banks need to become bigger \\nto gain this benefit (there are many highly success-\\nful banks that are smaller). What is clear is that \\nbanks should be allowed to pursue their individual \\nstrategies, including mergers and acquisitions, as \\nthey see fit. Overall, this process should be allowed \\nto happen — it’s part of the natural and healthy \\ncourse of capitalism — and it can be done without \\nharming the American taxpayer or economy. \\nWhile we all want a strong banking and financial \\nsystem, we should step back and assess how all the \\nregulatory steps we have taken measure up against \\nthe goals we all share. Since Dodd-Frank was signed \\ninto law in 2010, thousands of rules and reporting \\nrequirements written by 10+ different regulatory \\nbodies in the United States alone have been added. \\nAnd it would probably be an understatement to say \\nthat some are duplicative, inconsistent, procyclical, \\ncontradictory, extremely costly, and unnecessarily \\npainful for both banks and regulators. Many of the \\nrules have unintended consequences that are not \\ndesirable and have negative impacts, such as \\nincreasing the cost of credit for consumers (hurting \\nlower-income Americans the most). \\nUPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY\\n30'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 32, 'page_label': '31'}, page_content='The whole process, including the Base l III \\nendgame, could be much more productive, \\nstreamlined, economical, efficient and safe.\\nBoth regulators and banks should want the same \\nthing — a healthy banking system, serving its cli -\\nents and striving for continuous improvement.  \\nWe all should also want the enormous benefits that \\nwould come from good collaboration between reg -\\nulators and bank management teams and boards. \\nOver time, these relationships have deteriorated, \\nand, again, are increasingly less constructive. \\nThere is little real collaboration between practi -\\ntioners — the banks — and regulators, who gener -\\nally have not been practitioners in business.

That means for every loan and \\nasset financed in the United States by a major \\nAmerican bank, that bank would have to hold \\n30% more capital than any international com -\\npetitor. The proposed regulations would also \\ndamage market making (see the following sec-\\ntion). There are many other flaws but suffice it to \\nsay that much of the work being done today to \\nanalyze the effects should have been done \\nbefore the proposed rulemaking. \\nOne of the single most important lessons from \\nthe great financial crisis is that there is  \\nenormous value to having a bank that is \\nwell-managed and has diverse revenue sources. \\nYet regulation since then both punishes  \\nconsolidation and diversification — and  punishes \\nperformance — through many features of the \\nGSIB surcharge. \\n• Built over many years, the framework is now \\nfull of duplication. The following is only a par-\\ntial list: American gold-plating and conceptual \\ninconsistencies among Comprehensive Capital \\nAnalysis and Review (CCAR), recovery and reso -\\nlution plans, liquidity requirements, global sys -\\ntemically important bank (GSIB) requirements, \\nand safety and soundness principles. The many \\noverlapping rules contribute to the bureaucracy \\nthat generates an extraordinary amount of \\nmake-work (an 80,000-page CCAR and shock -\\ningly another, coincidentally, 80,000-page  \\nrecovery and resolution plan).\\n• The new rules do virtually nothing to fix what \\ncaused the failure of SVB and First Republic. \\nFor example, they don’t improve certain liquidity \\nrequirements, limit HTM accounting or reduce \\nallowable interest rate exposure. \\n• The current regulatory approach to liquidity \\nmight simply run counter to the stated intent. \\nRegulations should recognize the value and \\nimportance of lending and borrowing against \\ngood collateral and using central bank \\nresources, such as the discount window.  \\nAdhering to current liquidity requirements per-\\nmanently ties up good liquidity in a way that \\nmakes the system more fragile and more risky. \\n• It is not clear what the full intent of the Basel \\nIII endgame was — it will have unintended con -\\nsequences. Without real analysis of expected \\noutcomes, additional regulation will likely \\nreduce the number of banks offering certain \\nservices and increase costs for all market partic -\\nipants and activity, including loans, market  \\nmaking and hedging (by farmers, airlines and \\ncountries, among others). And new rules might \\neven increase consolidation as companies race \\nto achieve economies of scale in certain prod -\\nucts and services. \\nUPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY\\n31'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 33, 'page_label': '32'}, page_content='Unfortunately, some recent regulations are ending \\nup in court.

The Urban Institute estimates that \\na reduction like this would increase mortgage \\noriginations by 1 million per year and help  \\nlower-income households, in particular, buy  \\ntheir first home, thereby starting them on the \\nbest way to build household net worth. \\nThere are many more things that can be improved \\n— and we really should start working on them.\\nWe need a detailed review and probably a \\ncomplete revamp.\\nI know this might be wishful thinking, but now \\nwould be a good time to step back and have a thor-\\nough and candid review of the thousands of new \\nrules passed since Dodd-Frank. After this review, we \\nshould ask what is it that we really want: Do we \\nwant to try to eliminate the possibility of bank runs? \\nDo we want to change and create liquidity rules that \\nwould essentially back most uninsured deposits? Do \\nwe want the mortgage business and leveraged lend-\\ning business to be inside or outside the banking sys-\\ntem?

There are \\nhealthy markets in farm animals, foreign prod -\\nucts, commodities, energy, logistics, healthcare \\nand so on. Healthy markets increase customer \\nchoice and reduce cost. They almost always \\ninvolve holding inventory and taking some risk, \\nwhich is simply a part of the process. America’s \\nfinancial markets are the biggest in the world — \\nU.S. public debt and equity markets total $137 \\ntrillion, constituting the biggest “market” in the \\nworld, and are larger than America’s gross \\ndomestic product (GDP) of $27 trillion. \\nMarket participants are not “Wall Street.” They are \\nlarge and small, mainly sophisticated, global inves -\\ntors (pension plans, mutual funds, governments \\nand individuals) representing retirees, veterans, \\nindividuals, unions, federal workers and others. \\nThey all benefit from our efficient, low-cost and \\ntransparent markets. \\nSome regulators seem to think that market making \\nis a speculative, hedge fund-like activity — and this \\nthinking is what might be leading them to con-\\nstantly increase capital requirements. The pro -\\nposed capital rules could fundamentally alter  \\nmarket-making activities that are critical to a \\n thriving economy, particularly in difficult markets \\nwhen market making is even more important .  \\nThe new rules would raise capital requirements  \\nby 50% for major banks — which could undermine \\nmarket stability, make banking services costlier \\nand less accessible, and push even more activity  \\nto a less regulated banking system.\\nOur financial system and markets are the best \\nin the world and benefit ALL participants; \\nexceptionally good market making in the \\nsecondary market makes our primary markets \\nthe best in the world. \\nWe should recognize that the United States has the \\nbiggest, deepest and most liquid capital markets in \\nthe world. For these markets to function, it is  \\ncritical for transparency and liquidity to be in the \\nsecondary market . Market making provides this, \\npromoting the flow of capital to real economy \\ninvestments and supporting all sectors of the \\neconomy, including companies, state and local \\ngovernments, universities, hospitals, pension plans \\nand overall job creation. Without market making in \\nthe secondary market, it would be extremely diffi -\\ncult for companies to raise capital through the  \\nprimary market — equity and debt offerings — \\nwhich have totaled approximately $3.6 trillion on \\naverage over the past few years. The incredible \\nstrength of these markets enables companies of \\nall sizes to grow and expand especially during times \\nof volatility and stress. It also enables consumers to \\naccess cheaper credit and governments (local, state \\nand federal) to reduce their borrowing costs. \\nIt takes enormous resources to properly \\nsupport the Markets business. \\nJPMorgan Chase spends $700 million per year in \\nextensive research coverage of nearly 5,200  \\ncompanies across 83 countries. This massive effort \\ncontinuously educates investors and decision  \\nmakers around the world and often leads to \\nimproved governance and management. It also \\ncritically complements the firm’s market-making \\nactivities and further promotes transparency, \\nenabling investors to make thoughtful choices \\naround investing in capital markets. \\nI would also like our shareholders to know that  \\nour market making is backed by approximately \\n $7 billion in support expenses, including over \\n $2 billion in technology spend alone each year. \\nThis investment allows us to maintain global  \\ntrading systems and constantly improve upon risk \\nmanagement and efficiency. \\nJPMorgan Chase deploys approximately $70 billion \\nin capital to maintain our Markets franchise.

Part of our brand promise is to stand \\nready as the willing buyer and seller. In this, we \\nhave never failed. In addition, in most cases \\nregarding government debt, where we serve as a \\ngovernment securities dealer, we are legally obli-\\ngated to make markets. This constant visibility into \\nprices provided by market makers fosters investor \\nconfidence, keeps fees low and promotes economic \\ngrowth by attracting more investors.\\nMany large market participants — for example, \\nhedge funds and high-frequency traders, among \\nothers — have no obligation to make markets. In \\nfact, many of these market participants often “step \\nout” of the markets and dramatically reduce liquid-\\nity specifically when market conditions are difficult. \\nMarket making is not particularly speculative since \\nmarket makers generally hedge their positions, as \\nyou will see from some real life examples of the \\neconomics and risks. We earn revenue of approxi -\\nmately $100 million on a typical day. In the aver-\\nage year, the total is nearly $30 billion. On our  \\n$2 trillion in notional daily trading, this amounts to \\nonly one hundredth of a cent charged to the inves -\\ntor for these services — an extraordinarily low cost \\ncompared with any other market in the world. \\nNow let’s take a look at the actual risk and results \\nversus the hypothetical risk and results. The hypo -\\nthetical global market shock of the CCAR stress \\ntest has us losing $18 billion in a single day and \\nnever recovering any of it. Let’s compare that to \\nactual losses under real, actual market stress. \\nNow consider these historical data points: First, \\nover the last 10 years, the firm’s market-making \\nbusiness has never had a quarterly loss and has  \\nlost money on only 30 trading days. These loss days \\nrepresent only 1% of total trading days, and the \\naverage loss on those days was $90 million. Second, \\nwhen markets completely collapsed during the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic (from March 2 through March \\n31, 2020, the stock market fell 16%, and bond \\nspreads gapped out dramatically), J.P. Morgan’s \\nmarket-making activities made money every day \\nprior to the Federal Reserve’s major interventions, \\nwhich stabilized the markets. During that entire \\nmonth, we lost money on only two days but made \\n$2.5 billion in Markets revenue for the month. And \\nthird, in the worst quarter ever in the markets fol-\\nlowing the 2008 failure of Lehman Brothers, we lost \\n$1.7 billion, but we made $5.6 billion in Markets rev-\\nenue for the full year. The firm as a whole did not \\nlose money in any quarter that year. In 2009, there \\nwas a complete recovery in Markets, and we made \\n$22 billion in Markets revenue. \\nYou can see that our actual performance under \\nextreme stress isn’t even close to the hypothetical \\nlosses of the stress test. \\nAnother major fallacy is that derivatives are \\nobjects of financial destruction. In reality, deriva -\\ntives are an essential part of managing financial \\nrisk and are used by investors, corporations, farm -\\ners, businesses, countries, governments and oth -\\ners to manage their risks. And more than 85% of \\nderivatives are fairly basic forms of foreign \\nexchange or interest rate swaps.\\nOne last fallacy is that the repo markets are all \\nabout speculation. While it’s true that repo is used \\nby certain investors to leverage up their positions, \\nabout 75% of repo is essential to normal money \\nmarket functioning, i.e., is done by broker-dealers \\nfinancing their actual inventory positions, money \\nmarket funds investing their cash backed by highly \\nrated collateral and clients hedging their positions. \\nMarket makers add confidence, liquidity and \\ntransparency to U.S. capital markets — market \\nmaking helps stabilize markets and can reduce \\nvolatility. \\nIn addition, more liquidity, not less liquidity, will be \\nneeded to maintain market stability. Large banks \\nkeep an inventory of securities they can deploy in \\ntimes of stress to help soothe markets; however, \\nwith the implementation of new regulations, banks \\nnow hold 70% as much inventory in securities as \\nthey did before the 2008 financial crisis, while the \\ntotal size of the market has almost tripled.

Consumers seeking a mort-\\ngage — including first-time homebuyers and his -\\ntorically underserved, low- to moderate-income \\nborrowers with smaller down payments — will \\nface higher interest rates or will have a tougher \\ntime accessing one. This will occur not only \\nbecause the cost of originating and holding \\nthese loans is higher but also because the cost \\nof securitizing them will rise for banks, non -\\nbanks and government agencies. Not only that, \\nbut the proposal will likely lead to reductions in \\nthe size of unfunded credit card lines, which will \\nput pressure on FICO scores and thereby make it \\nmore difficult for some people to access other \\nforms of retail credit such as mortgages. Again, \\nthis will have the greatest impact on low- to \\nmoderate-income borrowers who rely most \\nheavily on credit cards for day-to-day spending \\nand to build their credit history. It could even be \\nargued that existing regulations go too far and \\nthat there is an opportunity to help underserved \\ncommunities by dialing down regulations that \\nlead to higher borrowing costs. This should be \\nstudied and the pros and cons analyzed. The \\nsame can be said for small business loans, which \\nwill become more expensive and less accessible.\\n• Saving for retirement or college will be harder. \\nThe cost of products that families count on to \\nsave for retirement or college will go up as a \\nresult of this proposal. Asset managers, money \\nmarket funds and pension funds all buy, sell \\nand safekeep securities and other financial \\ninstruments for American investors. Under the \\nproposed rules, the cost of banking products \\nused on behalf of clients each day — including \\nbrokerage, advisory, clearing and custody  \\nservices — will go up and feed through to  \\ncustomers. That will lead to lower returns on \\nretirement accounts, college funds and other \\nlong-term savings. \\n• Government infrastructure projects and cor -\\nporate development will become more expen -\\nsive. Federal, state and local governments, as \\nwell as corporations and other institutions, rely \\non large banks for access to U.S. capital markets \\nto fund development. If accessing capital mar-\\nkets becomes more expensive, it will have a rip -\\nple effect on the hiring of American workers, \\ninvestment in research and development, and \\nfunding to build hospitals, roads and bridges, \\nincluding the planned infrastructure projects \\nfrom the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\\nMore market activity will move to unregulated \\ninstitutions, out of sight from regulators and with -\\nout the same level of consumer protections that \\nAmericans expect from their banks.

From their peak in 1996 at 7,300,  \\nU.S. public companies now total 4,300 — the total \\nshould have grown dramatically, not shrunk.  \\nMeanwhile, the number of private U.S. companies \\nbacked by private equity firms — which does not \\ninclude the rising number of companies owned by \\nsovereign wealth funds and family offices — has \\ngrown from 1,900 to 11,200 over the last two \\ndecades. This trend is serious and may very well \\nincrease with more regulation and litigation  \\ncoming. Along with a frank assessment of the  \\nregulation landscape, we really need to consider:  \\nIs this the outcome we want? \\nThere are good reasons for private markets, and \\nsome good outcomes result from them. For exam -\\nple, companies can stay private longer if they wish \\nand raise more and different types of capital with -\\nout going to the public markets. However, taking a \\nwider view, I fear we may be driving companies \\nfrom the public markets. The reasons are complex \\nand may include factors such as intensified report -\\ning requirements (including investors’ growing \\nneeds for environmental, social and governance \\ninformation), higher litigation expenses, costly \\nregulations, cookie-cutter board governance, \\nshareholder activism, less compensation flexibility, \\nless capital flexibility, heightened public scrutiny \\nand the relentless pressure of quarterly earnings. \\nAlong with the universal proxy — which makes it \\neasier to put poorly qualified directors on a board \\n— the pressures to retreat from the public market \\nare mounting. In addition, corporate governance \\nprinciples are becoming more and more templated \\nand formulaic, a negative trend. For example, \\nproxy advisors may automatically judge directors \\nunfavorably if they have a long tenure on the \\nboard, without a fair assessment of their actual \\ncontributions or experience. Another example is \\nthe constant battle by some proxy advisors who try \\nto split the chairman and CEO role when there is no \\nevidence this makes a company better off — in fact, \\ntoday, lead directors generally hold most of the \\nauthorities previously assigned to the chairman. \\nThe governance of major corporations is evolving \\naway from guidance by governance principles that \\nfocus on a company’s relationship to long-term  \\neconomic value toward a bureaucratic compliance \\nexercise. Good corporate governance is critical, and \\na little common sense would go a long way.\\nTHE PRESSURE OF QUARTERLY \\nEARNINGS COMPOUNDED BY BAD \\nACCOUNTING AND BAD DECISIONS\\nThere is something very positive about detailed \\nand disciplined quarterly financial and operating \\nreporting. But company CEOs and boards of direc -\\ntors should resist the undue pressure of quarterly \\nearnings, and it is clearly somewhat their fault \\nwhen they don’t. However, it is naïve to think that \\nthe pressure doesn’t exist because companies that \\n“disappoint” can face extensive criticism, particu -\\nlarly those with a new or young CEO. It’s possible \\nfor companies to take short-term actions to \\nincrease earnings, such as selling more product \\ncheaply at the end of a quarter, cutting certain \\ninvestments that may be terrific but can show \\naccounting losses in the first year or two, or just \\ndeploying more aggressive accounting methods at \\ntimes. Once shortcuts like this begin, people all \\nover the company understand that it is okay to \\n“stretch” to meet your numbers. This could put you \\non a treadmill to ruin. Obviously, a company should \\nnot resort to these tactics, but it does happen in \\nthe public markets — and it’s probably less likely in \\nthe private markets. \\nTHE HIJACKING OF ANNUAL \\nSHAREHOLDER MEETINGS\\nOne of the reasons it is less desirable to be a public \\ncompany is because of the spiraling frivolousness of \\nthe annual shareholder meeting, which has \\ndevolved into mostly a showcase of grandstanding \\nand competing special interest groups.

We should try to come up \\nwith a far more constructive alternative.\\nTHE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF PROXY \\nADVISORS\\nThere are essentially two main proxy advisors in \\nthe United States. One is called Institutional  \\nShareholder Services (ISS), and the second is \\ncalled Glass Lewis. These proxy advisors started \\nout providing reams of data from companies to \\nhelp their institutional investor clients vote on \\nproxy matters (information on executive compen -\\nsation, stock returns, detail on directors, policies \\nand so on). However, they soon also began to pro-\\nvide advice on how shareholders should vote on \\nproxy matters. And, in fact, institutional investors \\ngenerally execute their voting on an ISS or Glass \\nLewis platform, which often includes a clear state -\\nment of the advisory service’s position. \\nI should also point out, because it may be relevant, \\nthat ISS is owned by Deutsche Boerse, a German \\ncompany, and Glass Lewis is owned by Peloton  \\nCapital, a Canadian private equity firm. I question \\nwhether American corporate governance should be \\ndetermined by for-profit international institutions \\nthat may have their own strong feelings about what \\nconstitutes good corporate governance.\\nWhile asset managers and institutional \\ninvestors have a fiduciary responsibility to \\nmake their own decisions, it is increasingly \\nclear that proxy advisors have undue \\ninfluence.\\nAsset managers (who manage money on behalf of \\nothers) and institutional investors (e.g., pension \\nplans and endowments) may rely on a variety of \\ninformation sources to support their valuation \\ndecision-making process. While data and recom -\\nmendations may form pieces of the information \\nmosaic, their votes should ultimately be based on \\nan independent application of their own voting \\nguidelines and policies. To the extent they use rec-\\nommendations from proxy advisors in their deci -\\nsion-making processes, they should disclose that \\nthey do so and should be satisfied that the infor-\\nmation upon which they are relying is accurate and \\nrelevant. However, many companies would argue \\nthat this information is frequently not balanced, \\nnot representative of the full view and not accu -\\nrate. In addition, companies complain that they \\noften cannot get the data corrected, and, there -\\nfore, a vote may go uncorrected. \\nAlmost all asset managers receive proxy advisor \\ndata and recommendations; while some asset man-\\nagers vote completely independently of this infor-\\nmation, the majority do not. Most asset managers \\nhave formed corporate governance or stewardship \\ncommittees that are responsible for their voting, \\nand these committee positions are often held not by \\nportfolio managers and research analysts (i.e., the \\npeople buying and analyzing the individual securi-\\nties) but by stewardship experts. While it is good to \\nhave stewardship experts, the reality is that many \\nof these committees default large portions of what \\nthey do to proxy advisors and, more troubling, make \\nit harder for actual portfolio managers to override \\nthis decision making. \\nSome have argued that it’s too hard and too expen-\\nsive to review the large number of proxies and proxy \\nproposals — this is both lazy and wrong.

We believe these actions \\nwill strengthen our relationships with our clients \\nand with companies while helping to build trust \\namong shareholders, investors and companies.\\nTHE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF  \\nPRIVATE CREDIT\\nI have already mentioned some of the benefits of \\nprivate credit, and I’ll now mention some more. \\nMany people in the private credit arena are very \\nsmart and creative and want to help the compa -\\nnies they invest in navigate through market shoals. \\nThey can move quickly, discreetly and flexibly. \\nMost generally understand that bad accounting \\ndrives bad decisions, and their goal is to make the \\nright decisions for the future of the company.\\nOn the other hand, not all players are that good. \\nAnd problems in the private credit market caused \\nby the bad players can leak onto the good ones, \\neven though private credit money is locked up for \\nyears. If investors feel mistreated, they will cry \\nfoul, and the government will respond by putting  \\na laser focus on the business. It’s a reasonable \\nassumption that at some point regulations will \\nfocus on the private markets as they do on the \\npublic markets. \\nThis scrutiny will include a look at how private \\ncredit values its assets, which isn’t as transparent \\nas public market valuations. In addition, private \\nmarket loans commonly lack liquidity in the sec-\\nondary market and are not generally supported by \\nin-depth market research.\\nNew financial products that grow extremely rap -\\nidly often become an area of unexpected risk in \\nthe markets. Frequently, the weaknesses of new \\nproducts, in this case private credit loans, may \\nonly be seen and exposed in bad markets, which \\nprivate credit loans have not yet faced. When \\ncredit spreads gap out, when interest rates go up \\nand when some leveraged companies suffer in the \\nrecession, we will find out how those loans survive \\nstress testing. In addition, they can create a little \\nbit of a “credit crunch” for borrowers since it \\nmight be hard for private creditors to roll over \\nloans under those conditions. Under stress condi -\\ntions, private creditors would have to charge exor-\\nbitant prices that companies simply cannot afford \\nin order to book the new loan at par. Banks are in a \\nslightly different position. \\n38\\nSTAYING COMPETITIVE IN THE SHRINKING PUBLIC MARKETS'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 40, 'page_label': '39'}, page_content='panies through good times and bad, seeking to \\nretain them as long-term clients across many \\nareas of the bank.

In business, you have to understand your \\ncompetitors, their distribution, their economics, \\ntheir innovations, and their strengths and weak -\\nnesses. You also need to understand customers \\nand their changing preferences, along with your \\nown costs, your people and their skills. Then \\nthere’s knowing how other factors fit in, like tech -\\nnology, risk, motivations … hope you get the point. \\nFor countries, you need a thorough grasp of their \\neconomies, strengths and weaknesses, population \\nand education, access to raw materials, laws and \\nregulations, history and culture. Research, data \\nand analytics should be at a very detailed level and \\nconstantly reassessed. Only after you complete \\nthis diligent study can you start to make plans with \\na high degree of success. \\nGet on the road — it builds knowledge and \\nculture. \\nI have frequently wondered about all the nonstop \\nroad trips, client meetings, briefings, greetings, \\nbus trips, and visits to call centers, operating  \\ncenters and branches, regulators and government \\nofficials, among others: Did they make a differ-\\nence? The answer is absolutely yes because they \\nenabled a process of constant learning, assess -\\nment and modification of best practices — gaining \\ninsights from employees to clients to competitors. \\nEmployees will tell you what you are doing well or \\npoorly if you simply ask them, and they know you \\nwant to hear the real answer. Curiosity is a form  \\nof humility — acknowledging that you don’t know \\neverything. Responding to curiosity allows other \\npeople to speak freely. Facts and details matter \\nand inform a deeper and deeper analysis that \\nallows you to continually revise and update your \\nplans. This, of course, also means that you are  \\nconstantly admitting prior mistakes. \\nYou need to shed sacred cows, seek out blind \\nspots and challenge the status quo.\\nVery often companies or individuals develop nar -\\nratives based upon beliefs that are very hard to \\ndislodge but are often wrong — and they can lead \\nto terrible mistakes.

Try not to allow yourself to \\nbecome rigid or “weaponized,” where other \\nemployees or interest groups jazz you up so much \\nthat you become a weapon on their behalf. This \\nmakes it much harder to see things clearly for \\nyourself. When people disagree with you, seek \\nout where they may be partially right. This opens \\nthe door for a deeper understanding and avoids \\nbinary thinking.\\nIt’s hard to see certain long-term trends, but \\nyou must try. \\nThere is too much emphasis on short-term, \\nmonthly data and too little on long-term trends \\nand on what might happen in the future that would \\ninfluence long-term outcomes. For example, today \\nthere is tremendous interest in monthly inflation \\ndata, although it seems to me that every long-term \\ntrend I see increases inflation relative to the last \\n20 years. Huge fiscal spending, the trillions needed \\neach year for the green economy, the remilitariza -\\ntion of the world and the restructuring of global \\ntrade — all are inflationary. I’m not sure models \\ncould pick this up. And you must use judgment if \\nyou want to evaluate impacts like these. \\nAlso, a block of time as short as one year is an arti -\\nficial framework for judging the impact of long-\\nterm trends that could easily play out over years.  \\nA helpful exercise is to think “future back,” in \\nwhich you imagine different future outcomes, \\nincluding the ones you want, and then work back -\\nward to events that are happening today (or that \\nmight happen or that you cause to happen), closely \\nexamining the connections between those events \\nand your projected or desired outcomes. Those \\nconnections inform your risk and R&D planning. \\nSimilarly, when companies compare the attributes \\nof their products and services with their competi -\\ntors, they usually only consider where they are \\nversus their competitors. But nothing is static — \\nthey should consider where their competitors will \\nbe in the future. Conditions are always changing, \\ncrises are always emerging.

The chant, “Don’t get \\ninvolved in foreign wars” was often right. That \\nsaid, the American public should remember that \\neven after the Revolutionary War, we did, in fact, \\nhave British and French armies on our soil. The \\nsinking of American merchant and passenger ships \\nduring World War I and the surprise attack on \\nPearl Harbor in World War II brought isolationism \\nto a close for a time.

Staying on the \\nsidelines during battles of autocracy and democ -\\nracy, between dictatorship and freedom, is simply \\nnot an option for America today. Ukraine is the \\nfront line of democracy. If the war goes badly  \\nfor Ukraine, you may see the splintering of Pax \\nAmericana, which would be a disaster for the \\nwhole free world.

There are \\nmany things we need to do to strengthen the U.S. \\neconomy, and I talk about that later in this section. \\nThis discussion is about foreign economic policies \\n— the economic battlefield.\\nThe whole Western world is rethinking and \\nreimagining its military strategies and alliances. \\nWe need to do the same for our economic strate -\\ngies and alliances, but we should be guided by a \\ncomprehensive global strategy that deals with \\ncritical issues. Done properly, such a strategy \\nwould help strengthen, coalesce and possibly be \\nthe glue that holds together Western democratic \\nalliances over decades.\\nForeign economic policy involves trade and invest-\\nment, export controls, secure and resilient supply \\nchains, and the execution of sanctions and any \\nrelated industrial policies. It must also include \\ndevelopment finance — think of the “Belt and Road” \\nefforts in China — which are critical to most develop-\\ning nations. This framework should tell us not only \\nhow to deal with our allies but also how to work with \\nnonaligned nations around the world. These strate-\\ngies should not be aimed against any one country \\n(such as China) but rather be focused on keeping \\nthe world safe for democracy and free enterprise. \\nEconomic national security is paramount — \\nboth for the United States and for our allies.\\nIt is a valid point that the Western world — both \\ngovernment and business — essentially underesti -\\nmated the growing strength and potential threat of \\nChina. It’s also true that China has been compre -\\nhensively and strategically focused on these eco -\\nnomic issues, all while we slept. But let’s not cry \\nover spilled milk — let’s just fix it. \\nWe missed the potential threat from three vantage \\npoints. The first is companies’ overreliance on \\nChina as the sole link in their supply chain, which \\ncan create vulnerabilities and reduces resiliency. \\nBut to the extent this involves everyday items, like \\nclothes, sneakers, vaccine compounds and con -\\nsumer goods, this dependency is not as critical or \\ncomplex and will eventually be sorted out. \\nThe second is the most critical. The United States \\ncannot rely on any potential adversaries for mate -\\nrials essential to our national security — think rare \\nearths, 5G and semiconductors, penicillin and \\nmaterials critical to essential pharmaceuticals, \\namong others. We also cannot be sharing vital \\ntechnologies that can enhance an adversary’s  \\nmilitary capabilities. The United States should \\nproperly and narrowly define these issues and \\nthen act unilaterally, if necessary, to fix them. \\nThe third is also complex, which is countering \\nunfair competition or “mercantilist” behavior in \\ncritical industries; think electric vehicles, renew -\\nable energy and AI, among others. Examples of \\nthis would be where a state, any state, uses gov -\\nernment powers, capital, subsidies or other means \\nto dominate critical industries and deeply damage \\nthe economic position of other nations. Weakening \\na country economically can render it a virtual \\n“vassal state,” reliant on potential adversaries for \\nessential goods and services, which also weakens \\nit militarily. We cannot cede our important \\nresources and capabilities to potential adversaries. \\nAll these issues can be resolved, though they will \\ntake time and need devoted effort. \\nEvery nation will have different national security \\nissues. For example, Europe in general and coun -\\ntries like India, Japan and Korea need reliable, \\naffordable and secure energy; many nations would \\nput food security as their top concern. This means \\nthat we must work with our allies to accomplish \\nour own goals and to help them accomplish theirs. \\nWe have extraordinary common interests in our \\njoint security: We must hang together — because if \\nwe don’t, we will assuredly hang separately. \\nWe already engage in trade — improving it is \\ngood economics and great geopolitics.\\nWe must have a better understanding of trade.  \\nAs a nation, we refuse to get into genuine trade \\ndiscussions, but this ignores the complete and \\nobvious truth — we already have trade relation-\\nships with all these countries.

While it \\nis appropriate to use trade to continue to nudge \\nallies in the right direction around human rights \\nand climate, this objective should be subordinated \\nto our national interests of long-term security. \\nNegotiating must be done in concert with our allied \\nnations so as not to cause a fissure in economic \\nrelations. This is critical — strong economic bonds \\nwill help ensure strong military alliances. The Infla-\\ntion Reduction Act has much good in it (more on this \\nlater), but it angered many of our allies. To them, \\nthe bill was by America and for America, and, sub-\\nsequently, they felt a need to match it so their busi-\\nnesses would not be disadvantaged. The terms of \\nthe legislation could have been better negotiated \\nwith our allies in mind, strengthening our economic \\nties with the free world. \\nWe should also immediately re-enter, if possible, \\nthe prior negotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership \\nagreement. Not only is it good for the economy, \\nbut it also could be a brilliant, strategic, economic \\nsecurity move — an economic alliance that binds \\nus with 11 other important countries (including \\nAustralia, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Singa -\\npore and Vietnam). Geopolitically and strategically, \\nthis might be one of the most important moves to \\ncounter China. While this is a challenging step, our \\npolitical leaders need to explain and lead — and \\nnot be afraid of dealing with the tough issues.  We \\nalso need to acknowledge that there have been \\nreal negative job impacts as a result of trade, \\nwhich are usually concentrated around certain \\nareas and businesses. So any new trade policy \\nshould be combined with a greatly enhanced Trade \\nAdjustment Assistance program, which provides \\nretraining, income assistance and relocation for \\nthose workers directly impacted by trade. \\nTrade is realpolitik, and the recent cancellation of \\nfuture liquified natural gas (LNG) projects is a good \\nexample of this fact. The projects were delayed \\nmainly for political reasons — to pacify those who \\nbelieve that gas is bad and that oil and gas proj -\\nects should simply be stopped. This is not only \\nwrong but also enormously naïve. One of the best \\nways to reduce CO2 for the next few decades is to \\nuse gas to replace coal. When oil and gas prices  \\nskyrocketed last winter, nations around the world — \\nwealthy and very climate-conscious nations like \\nFrance, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as \\nlower-income nations like Indonesia, the Philippines \\nand Vietnam that could not afford the higher cost — \\nstarted to turn back to their coal plants. This high-\\nlights the importance of safe, secure and affordable \\nenergy. Second, the export of LNG is a great eco-\\nnomic boon for the United States. But most import-\\nant is the realpolitik goal: Our allied nations that \\nneed secure and affordable energy resources, \\nincluding critical nations like Japan, Korea and most \\nof our European allies, would like to be able to \\ndepend on the United States for energy. This now \\nputs them in a difficult position — they may have to \\nlook elsewhere for such supplies, turning to Iran, \\nQatar, the United Arab Emirates or maybe even  \\nRussia. We need to minimize anything that can tear \\nat our economic bonds with our allies.\\nThe strength of our domestic production of energy \\ngives us a “power advantage” — cheaper and more \\nreliable energy, which creates economic and geo -\\npolitical advantages.\\nIndustrial policy is now necessary, but it \\nshould be carefully constructed and limited.\\nIn some cases, industrial policy (using government \\nresources to subsidize investments to help make \\nbusinesses more competitive) may be the only \\nsolution for quickly building up the industries we \\nneed (rare earths and semiconductors, among  \\nothers) to guarantee resilient national security. \\nThe IRA and CHIPS Act are good examples of this \\nand government has to get it right. \\nSuch policy can also be used to help combat unfair \\ncompetitive policies of nations that are using state \\ncapitalism and state control to dominate critical \\nindustries.

While he acknowledges the worthi -\\nness of the goals of many regulations, he \\npoints out their negatives. He also calls out \\nthe “blame-shifting and scapegoating” and \\n“the endless exposure to frivolous claims and \\nhigh legal fees.” Not only is this state of \\naffairs demoralizing, but it also reduces \\nemployment, capital investment and the for -\\nmation of new businesses, as well as cause \\nunnecessary bankruptcies. Estimates of the \\nregulatory costs for America are approxi -\\nmately $19,000 per worker, dwarfing the reg -\\nulatory burdens in other countries. We all \\nwant sensible regulations that make us a bet -\\nter and safer nation — but this number is \\nastounding. We should be able to accomplish \\nour goals while sharply reducing needless and \\nwasteful expenses. And remember, it’s dis -\\ncouraging not only to companies but to all cit -\\nizens who have to deal with it on a daily basis. \\n• Timely permits on projects large and small. \\nThere is virtually no industry — from agricul -\\nture and construction to transportation, tech -\\nnology, and oil and gas — or business, large or \\nsmall, that isn’t disadvantaged by the tedious \\nprocess and the length of time it takes to get \\napprovals for permits to get things done. This \\nincludes federal, state and local requirements. \\nThese bottlenecks also make investment far \\nmore costly and slow. Timely permits would \\nimprove infrastructure and save lives, not \\nendanger them.\\n• Proper federal government budgeting and  \\nfiscal management. The staggering inability  \\nof the government to draft and pass a proper \\nbudget causes deep and unnecessary damage \\nto our growth. Some people estimate that the \\nwaste alone (due to improper payments, over -\\nlapping programs, and fragmented and duplica -\\ntive contracts, among other things) could cost \\nthe nation hundreds of billions of dollars annu -\\nally. This uncertainty filters through virtually \\nevery part of the American economy and should \\nnot be accepted. \\nWe can all forgo a little self-interest to do what \\nis right for our country.\\nThose of us who have benefited the most from this \\ncountry bear even greater responsibility to do this. \\nIt’s perfectly understandable that institutions, \\nincluding businesses, unions and industries, lobby  \\nin Washington, D.C., to protect themselves — in \\ngood ways and bad — but we should more regu -\\nlarly put national interests ahead of self-interests. \\nIt’s good to want to ensure well-paying jobs and \\nhealthy industries. But it is not good when it \\nreduces competition, stops the deployment of \\nenhanced technology, harms efficiency, creates \\nfake jobs or builds bridges to nowhere or damages \\nthe general health of the economy. Doing the right \\nthing, the right way — which is achievable — would \\nbe better for everyone. As former President John \\nF. Kennedy said, “Ask not what your country can do \\nfor you — ask what you can do for your country.”\\nCelebrate American exceptionalism.\\nWe can safely say that America is an exceptional \\nnation built and grounded on principles — princi -\\nples of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, \\nfree enterprise (capitalism), and the freedom and \\nempowerment brought to us by our democracy \\nthrough the power to elect our leaders and of our \\nConstitution, which makes these individual free -\\ndoms sacrosanct. Much of the world yearns to be \\nhere because of those principles — the right to life, \\nliberty and the pursuit of happiness. We should \\nextol those virtues while recognizing that America \\nhas never been a perfect nation, like all other \\nnations. We can acknowledge our flaws and strive \\nto constantly correct them, without denigrating \\nour nation. \\n51\\nA PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 53, 'page_label': '52'}, page_content='THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. \\nJUN E 01, 1992 (Copyright O /992 , Dow Jones & Co., Inc.) \\nManager\\'s ] oumal: \\nA Politician\\'s Dream ls a Businessman\\'s Nightmare \\nBy George McGovern \\nWisdom too often never comes, \\nand so one ought not to reject it merely \\nbecause it comes late. \\n-- Justice Felix Frankfurter \\nIt\\'s been 11 years since I left the \\nU.S. Senate, after serving 24 years in \\nhigh public office. After leaving a \\ncareer in politics, I devoted much of my \\ntime to public lectures that took me into \\nevery state in the union and much of \\nEurope, Asia, the Middle East and Latin \\nAmerica. \\nIn 1988, I invested most of the \\nearnings from this lecture circuit \\nacquiring the leasehold on Connecticut\\'s \\nStratford Inn . Hotels, inns and \\nrestaurants have always held a special \\nfascination for me. The Stratford Inn \\npromised the realization of a longtime \\ndream to own a combination hotel, \\nrestaurant and public conference \\nfacility -- complete with an experienced \\nmanager and staff. \\nIn retrospect, I wish I had known \\nmore about the hazards and difficulties \\nof such a business, especially during a \\nrecession of the kind that hit New \\nEngland just as I was acquiring the \\ninn\\'s 43-year leasehold. I also wish \\nthat during the years I was in public \\noffice, I had had this firsthand \\nexperience about the difficulties \\nbusiness people face every day. That \\nknowledge would have made me a \\nbetter U.S. senator and a more \\nunderstanding presidential contender. \\nToday we are much closer to a \\ngeneral acknowledgment that \\ngovernment must encourage business to \\nexpand and grow. Bill Clinton, Paul \\nTsongas, Bob Kerrey and others have, I \\nbelieve, changed the debate of our \\nparty. We intuitively know that to \\ncreate job opportunities we need \\nentrepreneurs who will risk their capital \\nagainst an expected payoff. Too often, \\nhowever, public policy does not consider \\nwhether we are choking off those \\nopportunities. \\nMy own business perspective has \\nbeen limited to that small hotel and \\nrestaurant in Stratford, Conn., with an \\nespecially difficult lease and a severe \\nrecession. But my business associates \\nand I also lived with federal, state and \\nlocal rules that were all passed with the \\nobjective of helping employees, \\nprotecting the environment, raising tax \\ndollars for schools, protecting our \\ncustomers from fire hazards, etc. While \\nI never have doubted the worthiness of \\nany of these goals, the concept that \\nmost often eludes legislators is: \"Can \\nwe make consumers pay the higher \\nprices for the increased operating costs \\nthat accompany public regnlation and \\ngovernment reporting requirements \\nwith reams of red tape.\" It is a simple \\nconcern that is nonetheless often \\nignored by legislators. \\nFor example, the papers today \\nare filled with stories about businesses \\ndropping health coverage for \\nemployees. We provided a substantial \\npackage for our staff at the Stratford \\nInn. However, were we operating today, \\nthose costs would exceed $150,000 a year \\nfor health care on top of salaries and \\nother benefits. There would have been \\nno reasonable way for us to absorb or \\npass on these costs. \\nSome of the escalation in the \\ncost of health care is attributed to \\npatients suing doctors. While one \\ncannot assess the merit of all these \\nclaims, I\\'ve also witnessed firsthand the \\nexplosion in blame -shifting and \\nscapegoating for every negative \\nexperience in life. \\nToday, despite bankruptcy, we \\nare still dealing with litigation from \\nindividuals who fell in or near our \\nrestaurant. Despite these injuries, not \\ncause. But that reason masks the \\nvariety of other challenges we faced \\nthat drive operating costs and financing \\ncharges beyond what a small business \\ncan handle. \\nIt is clear that some businesses \\nhave products that can be priced at \\nalmost any level. The price of raw \\nmaterials (e.g., steel and glass) and \\nlife-saving drugs and medical care \\nare not easily substituted by consumers. \\nIt is only competition or antitrust that \\ntempers price increases. Consumers \\nmay delay purchases, but they have \\nlittle choice when faced with higher \\nprices. \\nIn services, however, consumers \\ndo have a choice when faced with \\nhigher prices. You may have to stay in \\na hotel while on vacation, but you can \\nstay fewer days. You can eat in \\nrestaurants fewer times per month, or \\nforgo a number of services from car \\nwashes to shoeshines. Every such \\ndecision eventually results in job losses \\nfor someone. And often these are the \\npeople without the skills to help \\nthemselves -· the people I\\'ve spent a \\nlifetime trying to help. \\nIn short, \"one-size-fits-all\" \\nrules for business ignore the reality of \\nthe marketplace. And setting thresholds \\nfor regulatory guidelines at artificial \\nlevels -- e.g., 50 employees or more, \\n$500,000 in sales -- takes no account of \\nother realities, such as profit margins, \\nlabor intensive vs. capital intensive \\nbusinesses, and local market \\neconomics. \\nThe problem we face as \\nlegislators is: Where do we set the bar \\nso that it is not too high to clear? I don\\'t \\nhave the answer. I do know that we \\nevery misstep is the fault of someone need to start raising these questions \\nelse. Not every such incident should be more often. \\nviewed as a lawsuit instead of an \\nunfortunate accident. And while the \\nbusiness owner may prevail in the end, \\nthe endless exposure to frivolous claims \\nand high legal fees is frightening. \\nOur Connecticut hotel, along \\nwith many others, went bankrupt for a \\nvariety of reasons, the general economy \\nin the Northeast being a significant \\nMr. McGovern, the 1972 \\nDemocratic presidential candidate, is \\npresident of the Middle-Eastern \\nPolicy Council in Washington. \\n(See related letters: \"Letters to \\nthe Editor: A Politician\\'s Dream Is a \\nBusinessman\\'s Nightmare\" -- WSJ July \\n2, 1992) \\nTHE PUBUSH£R\\'S SAU OF THIS REPRINT Does NOT CONSTITUTE OR IIIPI. y ANY ENOORSEIIENT OR Sl\\'ONSORSIIP OF ANY PROOIICT, SEl!VIC£.

Our Constitution and Bill \\nof Rights secure our individual freedoms and reserve all rights \\nto the individual other than those important but limited \\nauthorities given to the government.\\nThe issue of individual rights is not all or none or freedom ver -\\nsus no freedom.

But \\nwe all know that democracy can be sloppy: Maintaining an \\neffective democracy is hard work. Democracy fosters open \\ndebate and compromise, which lead to better decisions over \\ntime (whether in government or in business).

Their decisions are based on a completely \\ndifferent calculation, and their decision-making process does \\nnot encourage and, therefore, benefit from open \\ndebate.

Nearly 40% of Americans don’t have $400 in savings to \\ndeal with unexpected expenses, such as medical bills or car \\nrepairs, which leads to financial distress. More than 25 million \\nAmericans don’t have medical insurance at all; of these, one in \\nfive are in a family with income below the federal poverty level. \\nPeople who live in low-income neighborhoods also tend to have \\nworse health outcomes, including higher rates of mental health \\nissues, depression and suicide, and a lower life expectancy — as \\nmany as 20 years. Finally, low-income Americans generally \\nexperience higher unemployment and more crime. \\nNo one can claim that the promise of equal opportunity is being \\noffered to all Americans through our education systems. \\nStudents in the lowest socioeconomic bracket are 50% less \\nlikely to attend college than those in the highest socioeconomic \\ngroups. Many inner city schools graduate under 50% of their \\nstudents — and even those who graduate may not be well-\\nprepared for the workforce. In addition, boys growing up in the \\nbottom 10% of family income are 20 times more likely to be \\nincarcerated. Those who do run afoul of our justice system \\ngenerally do not get the second chance that many of them \\ndeserve. Their exclusion from the workforce is not only unfair \\nto them but also results in an estimated $87 billion average \\nannual cost to the economy. \\nToo many policies that are wrong — affecting housing and \\nmortgage markets, healthcare, immigration, regulation, \\neducation and student lending, to name a few — are \\njeopardizing the opportunity for American citizens to succeed. \\nThe people who suffer the most, throughout all of this, are not \\nhigh-income individuals. I strongly believe that these outcomes \\nare destroying the concept of “fair” in America and are driving \\npopulism and diminishing, if not eliminating, trust — not only in \\ngovernment but in all our institutions. Simply put, the social \\nneeds of far too many of our citizens are not being met. We \\nshould never accept these outcomes — we must fix them. \\nThere are two policy changes that I believe can have a dramatic \\neffect on jobs, growth and equality — and they go a long way \\ntoward repairing the frayed American dream. Let’s start by \\ntreating all jobs with respect. Even starter jobs, which are the \\nfirst rung on the ladder of opportunity, bring dignity and create \\nbetter social outcomes in terms of health, higher household \\nformation and lower crime. Of these two policy changes, one \\nwould better utilize existing resources, and the other would \\ncost some money. But both would significantly change \\noutcomes for low-income Americans. \\nThe free one is so blindingly obvious that it’s almost \\nembarrassing to propose. Our schools (high schools, \\ncommunity colleges and perhaps even four-year colleges) \\nshould take responsibility for outcomes — they should be \\njudged on the quality and income level of the jobs that their \\ngraduates and even non-graduates attain. This means providing \\ngraduating students and other individuals with work skills (in \\nfields such as advanced manufacturing, cyber, data science and \\ntechnology, healthcare and so on) that will lead to better paying \\njobs. These schools should work with local businesses to \\nreplicate effective programs that are in place — because that is \\nwhere the actual jobs are now. This would be good for growth \\nand, as there are so many examples of successful programs, we \\n57\\nA PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 59, 'page_label': '58'}, page_content='already know what to do. With nearly 9 million job openings \\nand just under 6 million unemployed workers in the United \\nStates, job skills training has never been needed more. We \\nalready spend a tremendous amount of money on education — \\njust not the right way.\\nThe second step is related to the first: Get more income to low-\\npaid workers. While this one would cost money, it is to me a \\ncomplete no-brainer since it is an expansion of an existing \\nprogram, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which many \\nDemocrats and Republicans already agree upon. Today, the \\nEITC supplements low- to moderate-income working individuals \\nand couples, particularly with children and people living in rural \\nareas. For example, a single mother with two children earning \\n$9 an hour (approximately $20,000 a year) could receive a tax \\ncredit of more than $6,000 at year-end. Workers without \\nchildren receive a very small tax credit (96% of all EITC dollars \\nwere received by families with children). This should be \\ndramatically expanded, including eliminating the child \\nrequirement from the calculation altogether. We should convert \\nthe EITC to make it more like a negative income payroll tax, \\npaid monthly. Any tax credit income should not be offset by any \\nother benefits these individuals already receive (we have to \\neliminate benefit “cliffs” that disincentivize work). \\nAn increase in the EITC to a maximum of $10,000 would cost \\ntens of billions a year, but I have little doubt that these policy \\nchanges would do more than anything else to lift up low-\\nincome families and their communities. Well-paying jobs have \\nbeen shown to reduce crime, increase household formation, \\nimprove health and reduce addiction. Both of these policies \\nwould have the virtue of increasing the number of people in the \\nworkforce. I also have little doubt that this would add to GDP. \\nWe should attack all our other problems as well, but these two \\npolicy changes alone would dramatically improve our low-\\nincome neighborhoods, broadly strengthen the economy and \\ngive more opportunity to deserving citizens. It would restore \\nthe American Dream for many. \\n58\\n A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 60, 'page_label': '59'}, page_content='In Closing\\nIt’s been 20 years since the Bank One-JPMorgan Chase merger — and it’s been  \\nan extraordinary journey.

We’ll continue  \\nto drive growth by expanding branches \\nand evolving products to meet customer \\nneeds by segment. \\nBranches remain the hub for our local \\nteam of experts — over 50,000 bankers, \\nadvisors and business relationship  \\nmanagers — and a key distribution channel \\nfor all parts of the firm. We continue to \\noptimize our network of over 4,800 \\nbranches as we aim to be within a  \\n10-minute drive for 70% of the U.S.  \\npopulation. This will help us grow share  \\nin major metropolitan areas like Boston, \\nPhiladelphia and Washington, D.C., as \\nwell as states with mostly rural popula-\\ntions such as Alabama and Iowa, where \\nwe are also expanding our presence. \\nWe’ve added more than 650 new \\nbranches in the last five years, by far  \\nthe most of any bank in the U.S. We’re \\ndoubling down on that investment and \\nwill add 500+ branches over the next \\nthree years. The result is a significantly \\nyounger branch network, which creates \\nembedded growth that already has driven \\nshare gains and will continue to do so for \\nyears to come. Newer or “unseasoned” \\nbranches represent more than $150 bil -\\nlion in incremental deposit upside as they \\nmature. At the same time, we are consoli-\\ndating older branches in certain markets \\nin response to shifting customer behavior.\\nWe aim to be the bank for all, so tailoring \\nproducts, services and experiences for \\neach customer segment and community is \\ncentral to our strategy. We’re increasingly \\nfocused on supporting the financial health \\nof customers and communities through \\ndigital and in-person resources, such as \\nour nearly 150 dedicated Community  \\nManagers. We now have 16 Community \\nCenter branches and plan to open three \\nmore in 2024.\\nWe started 2023 with a goal of maintain -\\ning primary bank relationships and cap-\\nturing money in motion, and we did both. \\nWe retained over 95% of our primary \\nbank customers and succeeded in deep-\\nening with investments and an enhanced, \\nhigher-yield product set — including  \\ncompetitive-rate CDs and the new  \\nJ.P. Morgan Premium Deposit account. As \\na result, we successfully captured more \\nthan 80% of yield-seeking flows in 2023. \\nBusiness Banking \\nWe offer small business owners a compre-\\nhensive product suite to help them start, \\nrun and grow their businesses. We’re #1 \\nin small business primary bank share  \\nwith 9.5% of a fragmented market and \\nplan to grow by:\\n• Increasing banker capacity to better \\nco\\nver large clients, which drives higher \\nretention, cross-product deepening and \\nclient satisfaction.

In 2023, CCB spent over  \\n$3 billion on technology investments \\nspanning both product development and \\nmodernization. \\nA little over half of our annual investment \\nis focused on product development, help-\\ning ensure we have the best products,  \\nservices and channels to meet customers’ \\nevolving needs. From paying a bill and \\nchecking a balance to replacing a card \\nand disputing a transaction, we’re making \\nprocesses more seamless, taking friction \\nout of customers’ everyday financial lives. \\nAt the same time, customers are increas-\\ningly engaging with our advice-oriented \\ndigital and omnichannel experiences to \\nmeet their more complex needs, like buy-\\ning a home or planning for retirement. \\nEngaged online activity — beyond viewing \\nbalances — is up 25% since 2019. \\nThe rest of our technology investment is \\nfocused on modernization, which is both \\noffensive and defensive. We need to \\ndeliver new products and experiences \\nmore quickly while executing with resil-\\niency at massive scale to stay competitive \\nand avoid being disrupted. We’ve made \\nsignificant progress and are on track to \\nsubstantially complete data center migra-\\ntion by the end of 2024. We’ve also \\nmigrated almost 90% of our data to the \\npublic cloud. Looking ahead, we’ll con-\\ntinue to focus on modernizing our core \\nbanking infrastructure, which will enable \\nus to launch products faster, improve \\nplatform stability and reduce run-the-\\nbank expenses over time.\\nOur data migration efforts help us take full \\nadvantage of our extraordinary data \\nassets to deliver personalization at scale \\nand accelerate existing and future AI initia-\\ntives. We’ve been using AI for years and \\nhave a strong foundation in place. Initially, \\nwe focused on using AI to drive cost reduc-\\ntion and risk avoidance, but we’ve pivoted \\nto focus more on revenue growth. We’ll \\ncontinue to invest where we will realize the \\ngreatest benefit, including:\\n• Optimizing marketing efforts to better \\ntar\\nget profitable prospects. \\n• Identifying unmet customer needs, then \\nad\\ndressing them in the moment with \\ndigital nudges and personalized offers.\\n• Increasing the productivity and effi-\\nci\\nency of our sales force through lead \\nmanagement and propensity models.\\n• Predicting in real time the likelihood  \\nof fr\\naud to better protect customers \\nand the firm.\\n• Supporting specialists with AI advance-\\nme\\nnts like call prediction, real-time \\ninsights and intelligent routing to drive \\ncustomer and employee satisfaction. \\nPROTECTING OUR CUSTOMERS \\nAND THE FIRM\\nRisk management is core to our culture \\nand a key competitive advantage, helping \\nus build trust and providing security to \\ncustomers. We are focused on protecting \\nshareholders, customers and the firm by \\nmaintaining our fortress balance sheet, \\nstrong controls environment and through-\\nthe-cycle decision-making approach.\\nCULTIVATING TALENT \\nThe work we do matters to customers, \\ncommunities and the economy overall.

We already serve customers \\nacross the wealth spectrum, but the \\nacquisition will help us deepen relation-\\nships with the affluent segment.

While we are on track against \\nkey integration milestones, 2024 will be \\ncritical as we aim to largely complete \\nintegration efforts by year-end. \\n2024 LOOK AHEAD\\nMacro factors \\nThe macro environment going forward \\nwill likely look very different from 2023. \\nWhile we anticipate the Federal Reserve \\nwill lower rates this year, the trajectory \\nis still uncertain. Lower rates will be a \\nheadwind for deposit margins but a  \\ntailwind for businesses such as Home \\nLending. The diversification of our  \\nfranchise provides natural offsets  \\nand hedges and creates resiliency in \\nearnings and performance.\\nWe are rigorous in monitoring our portfo -\\nlios at a granular level using multiple \\ndata sources to assess direct risk and the \\noverall health of consumers and small \\nbusinesses. Based on what we’re seeing,  \\nconsumers and small businesses both \\nstill remain generally healthy. Although \\nconsumers have largely spent the excess \\ncash reserves built up from the fiscal \\nresponse to the pandemic, balance \\nsheets remain strong. Spending on a per \\naccount basis is largely flat year-over-\\nyear. Delinquencies played out as \\nexpected in 2023, and credit card losses \\nshould fully normalize later this year. \\nRegulatory environment\\nThe banking industry is facing an unprec-\\nedented barrage of untested and unstud -\\nied proposed regulations and legislation \\ntargeting multiple aspects of our busi -\\nness. The combined impact of all of these \\n— Basel III, Regulation II (Debit Card  \\nInterchange Fees), overdraft and late fee \\nchanges, the Consumer Financial Protec-\\ntion Bureau’s Sections 1033 and 1071, and \\nthe Credit Card Competition Act — will \\nmeaningfully disrupt the economics of \\nconsumer financial products and services. \\nThis level of intervention will lead to some \\ncombination of the following:\\n• Fewer financial products and services \\navailable, and the remaining ones will \\nbecome more expensive and harder to \\naccess, especially for lower-income \\nconsumers. \\n• Less investment and innovation in the \\nfinancial services industry, leading to \\nan erosion of the customer experience.\\n• More consolidation across the industry, \\nwhich will limit consumer choice.\\n• More financial activity handled by  \\nnonbanks outside of the regulatory \\nperimeter, increasing risk for \\nconsumers.\\nOf course, we will comply with the final \\nrules and regulations and are relatively \\nwell-positioned to do so. However,  \\nconsumers and small businesses will \\nlikely bear the largest burden.  \\nOur hand \\nWe continue to operate from a position of \\nstrength with a relentless focus on the \\ncustomer, a proven strategy and the best \\nteam. We recognize headwinds on the \\nhorizon and will adapt accordingly, taking \\na through-the-cycle approach to manag -\\ning our business. Moving forward, we’ll \\ncontinue to:\\n• Execute with excellence and a focus on \\nefficiency and flexibility as the environ -\\nment around us changes.\\n• Engage with regulators on how  \\ncurrent proposals will negatively \\nimpact consumers and the industry.\\n• Reshape our business where necessary \\nin response to new regulations, balanc-\\ning impacts to shareholders, customers \\nand the communities we serve.\\nI remain very confident about the future \\nof our franchise, yet approach the oppor-\\ntunities and challenges we’ll face with \\ngreat humility.\\nMarianne Lake\\nCEO, Consumer & Community Banking\\nCONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 68, 'page_label': '67'}, page_content='COMMERCIAL & INVESTMENT BANK\\n67\\nCommercial &  \\nInvestment Bank\\nI am equally thrilled to spend more of  \\nmy time in my role as President and Chief \\nOperating Officer, helping Jamie with \\nfirmwide, strategic priorities that will  \\nprovide growth and opportunities for \\nyears to come.\\nMy focus will be on driving synergies \\nacross our lines of business, accelerating \\nour investments in growth and innova-\\ntion, and optimizing our resources across \\nthe firm.

We do not believe it is  \\nJ.P. Morgan’s job to tell clients what to \\ninclude or exclude inside their portfolio \\nsectors or stock selection.

In \\n2023, we committed:\\n• $1.5 million to The Commit Partner -\\nshi\\np’s Opportunity 2040 Plan Phase 1 \\nto support a comprehensive 18-year \\ninvestment plan to help improve the \\nlong-term financial health of 150,000 \\ncurrent students by 2040. \\n• $750,000 to the T3 Pathways to \\nCa\\nreers (P2C) platform to provide a  \\nvirtual college-to-career resource to \\nhelp parents and students understand \\nwhat’s needed to pursue industry- \\nbased credentials, degrees, certifica-\\ntions and job opportunities. \\nWe also promote policies at the local, \\nstate and federal levels that align with our \\ngoals.

Between 2017 and 2019,  \\nseveral reports captured the stark segre -\\ngation and inequities among communities \\nin Chicago, underscoring devastating \\nimpacts on economic vitality.\\nOur approach\\nLooking at this research and findings  \\nfrom the JPMorgan Chase Institute, we \\nrecognized an opportunity to change  \\nthe decades-long trajectory of the city’s \\nSouth and West Sides from disinvestment \\nto revitalization. Following conversations \\nwith policymakers and residents, we \\nfocused on addressing the city’s afford -\\nable home shortage as an opportunity  \\nto catalyze wealth building. \\nTo leverage vacant city-owned land, CR \\ndeepened partnerships with nonprofits \\nbuilding affordable homes in coordination \\nwith local government, including The  \\nResurrection Project, Reclaiming Chicago \\nand the Chicago Community Trust. These \\norganizations target city blocks to acquire \\nand build homes, supporting individual \\nand community wealth. They also connect \\npeople with affordable mortgages and \\nhelp them plan for costs like maintenance \\nand repairs. Additionally, our businesses \\ncombined expertise to make one of our \\nlargest-ever affordable housing invest-\\nments in redeveloping the Lawson YMCA \\ninto 400+ affordable housing units.\\nOur impact in action\\nWe see returns on our commitments in the \\npride and promise of new homeowners, \\nincluding Janay, a public school teacher. \\nJanay saved part of every paycheck to pur-\\nchase her first home and put down roots.\\n \\n“As a teacher, building a sense of commu-\\nnity is one of the first things I do with my \\nstudents at the beginning of the year. It  \\nis a way of making students feel safe,  \\nvalued and supported. This home does \\nthe same for me,” she reports.\\nJanay’s inspiring story is one of many. \\nHousing production from a collaborative \\nof organizations — funded in part through \\ngrants from JPMorgan Chase — surged \\nfrom 19 homes in 2022 to 79 homes in \\n2023, demonstrating significant progress \\ntoward the collaborative’s goal of scaling \\nproduction to more than 100 homes per \\nyear through 2030.\\nThis is just the beginning. In addition to \\ndeploying $1.1 million in home loans and \\nraising $50 million toward lending and \\nhome construction, our grantees have \\nleveraged our philanthropic support to \\nsecure another 500 city-owned vacant \\nlots and gain funding from the state of \\nIllinois focused on assisting with down \\npayments and closing appraisal gaps.\\nLOOKING AHEAD \\nThe essence of our work outlined  \\nabove can be captured in three words:  \\nWe show up. As listeners, learners and \\ncommunity partners, we come to the \\ntable — real, tangible tables — ready to \\ncreate avenues to economic opportunity.\\nAt these various tables, we ask: “What’s \\nworking?” We examine our investments \\nwith our colleagues across the firm and \\nexternal partners, gaining an understand -\\ning of how winning approaches can be \\nscaled to markets around the world. Our \\nteam’s work ensuring that policymakers \\nknow the value we bring to communities \\nbecomes all the more important as we \\nseek to scale solutions during this uncer-\\ntain political moment. It is in tandem with \\nelected officials and other stakeholders \\nthat we have brought, and will continue  \\nto bring, the right products and services \\nto our clients and customers.\\nAnd when we show up, in good and in \\ntough times, we will bring our holistic \\nmodel, positioning ourselves to grow and \\ntruly be the bank for the place we are in, \\nin every market we serve.

NII excluding Markets was \\n$90.0 billion, up 44%. \\n– Noninterest revenue (“NIR”) was $68.8 billion, up \\n11%, driven by the impact of First Republic, including \\nthe $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain, \\nhigher Markets noninterest revenue, and higher asset \\nmanagement fees, partially offset by the absence of the \\ngain on the sale of Visa B shares in the prior year, \\nhigher net securities losses in Treasury and CIO, and \\nlower auto operating lease income.\\n• Noninterest expense was $87.2 billion, up 14%, \\npredominantly driven by higher compensation expense, \\nreflecting an increase in employees, primarily in \\ntechnology and front office, as well as wage inflation. The \\nincrease in expense also includes the $2.9 billion FDIC \\nspecial assessment and costs associated with the First \\nRepublic acquisition. \\n• The provision for credit losses was $9.3 billion, \\nreflecting $6.2 billion of net charge-offs and a net \\naddition to the allowance for credit losses of $3.1 billion. \\nNet charge-offs increased $3.3 billion, predominantly \\ndriven by Card Services, and to a lesser extent single \\nname exposures in wholesale. The net addition to the \\nallowance for credit losses included: \\n– a net addition of $1.3 billion in consumer, \\npredominantly driven by CCB, reflecting $1.4 billion in \\nCard Services driven by loan growth, including an \\nincrease in revolving balances, partially offset by a net \\nreduction of $200 million in Home Lending, and\\n– a net addition of $657 million in wholesale, driven by \\nnet downgrade activity and a deterioration in the \\noutlook for commercial real estate in CB. \\nThe net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish \\nthe allowance for First Republic loans and lending-related \\ncommitments in the second quarter of 2023.\\nThe provision in the prior year included a $3.5 billion net \\naddition to the allowance for credit losses and net \\ncharge-offs of $2.9 billion.\\n• The total allowance for credit losses was $24.8 billion at \\nDecember 31, 2023.

That presentation, which is \\nreferred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an \\nunderstanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked \\nconsistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of \\nthe Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial \\nstatements of other companies.\\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported \\nbasis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the \\noverhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide \\nmanaged basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. \\nThe Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed \\nbasis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each \\ncase, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes \\ncertain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the \\nFirm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an \\nFTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that \\nreceive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in \\nthe managed results on a basis comparable to taxable \\ninvestments and securities. These financial measures allow \\nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue from \\nyear-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt \\nsources.

The \\nmanagement reporting process that derives business \\nsegment results includes the allocation of certain income \\nand expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the \\nassumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications \\nused for segment reporting, and therefore further \\nrefinements may be implemented in future periods. The \\nFirm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB \\non at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide \\nvarious business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and \\nits investors and analysts in assessing performance.\\nRevenue sharing \\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and \\nservices to the Firm’s clients and customers, the \\nparticipating business segments may agree to share \\nrevenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally \\nrecognized in the segment responsible for the related \\nproduct or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) \\ninvolved in the transaction. The segment results reflect \\nthese revenue-sharing agreements.\\nExpense allocation\\nWhere business segments use services provided by \\ncorporate support units, or another business segment, the \\ncosts of those services are allocated to the respective \\nbusiness segments. The expense is generally \\nallocated\\n based on the actual cost and use of services \\nprovided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related \\nto corporate support units, technology and operations that \\nare not currently utilized by any LOB are not allocated to \\nthe business segments and are retained in Corporate. \\nExpense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that \\nwould not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone \\nbusinesses, and other items not solely aligned with a \\nparticular business segment.\\nFunds transfer pricing \\nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the \\nFirm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and \\nOther Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk \\nand liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the interest \\nrate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities \\nand off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the \\nmethodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process \\nare adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other \\nfactors, which may impact the allocation of net interest \\nincome to the segments.\\nAs a result of the higher interest rate environment, the cost \\nof funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities have \\ngenerally increased, impacting the business segments’ net \\ninterest income. During the period ended December 31, \\n2023, this has resulted in higher cost of funds for loans and \\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 65'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 103, 'page_label': '66'}, page_content='Markets activities, and contributed to margin expansion on \\ndeposits.\\nForeign exchange risk\\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and \\nOther Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues \\nand expenses.

Markets includes both \\nFixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue \\nconsists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and \\nother income, as well as net interest income. \\nThe Firm \\nassesses its Markets business performance on a total \\nrevenue basis, as offsets\\n generally occur across revenue \\nline items. For example, securities that generate net \\ninterest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that \\nare \\nreflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. \\nRefer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition \\nof these income statement line items. \\nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial \\ninstruments and commodities transactions that arise from \\nclient-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions \\nrevenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new \\ntransactions with market participants, as well as “inventory-\\nr\\nelated revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains \\nand losses on derivatives and other instruments that the \\nFirm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, \\nc\\nlient demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments \\nused by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure \\narising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue \\nrecognized upon executing new transactions with market \\nparticipants is affected by many factors including the level \\nof client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the \\ndifference between the price at which a market participant \\ni\\ns willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the \\nprice at which another market participant is willing and able \\nto buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity \\na\\nnd volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive \\nto the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, \\nwhich include general market conditions, such as interest \\nrates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity \\na\\nnd commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic \\nconditions.  \\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 75\\nYear ended December 31,Year ended December 31,\\n2023 2022 2021'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 113, 'page_label': '76'}, page_content='For the periods presented below, the primary source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon \\nexecuting new transactions.\\n2023 2022 2021\\nYear ended December 31, \\n(in millions, except where \\notherwise noted)\\nFixed \\nIncome \\nMarkets\\nEquity \\nMarkets\\nTotal \\nMarkets\\nFixed \\nIncome \\nMarkets\\nEquity \\nMarkets\\nTotal \\nMarkets\\nFixed \\nIncome \\nMarkets\\nEquity \\nMarkets\\nTotal \\nMarkets\\nPrincipal transactions $ 12,064 $ 11,514 $ 23,578 $ 11,682 $ 8,846 $ 20,528 $ 7,911 $ 7,519 $ 15,430 \\nLending- and deposit-related fees  307  40  347  303  22  325  321  17  338 \\nCommissions and other fees  596  1,908  2,504  550  1,975  2,525  545  1,948  2,493 \\nAll other income  1,744  (87)  1,657  916  (99)  817  972  (82)  890 \\nNoninterest revenue  14,711  13,375  28,086  13,451  10,744  24,195  9,749  9,402  19,151 \\nNet interest income(a)  4,102  (4,396)  (294)  5,166  \\n(377)  4,789  7,116  1,127  8,243 \\nTotal net revenue $ 18,813 $ 8,979 $ 27,792 $ 18,617 $ 10,367 $ 28,984 $ 16,865 $ 10,529 $ 27,394 \\nLoss days(b) 3 7 4\\n(a) The decline in Markets net interest income was driven by higher funding costs.\\n(b) Loss days represent the number of days for which Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, posted losses to total net revenue. \\nThe loss days determined under this measure differ from the measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses.

When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale \\nloan, advises customers and clients on their investment \\ndecisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other \\nproducts or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. \\nThe Firm’s overall objective is to manage its \\nbusiness, and \\nthe associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the \\ninterests of its clients, customers and investors, and \\nprotecting the safety and soundness of the Firm.\\n \\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management requires, \\namong other things:\\n  \\n• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and \\nescalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;\\n  \\n• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and \\nmanagement within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and\\n \\n• A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation \\nframework with strong internal governance and \\nindependent oversight by the Board of Directors (the \\n“\\nBoard”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully \\nconsidered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and \\nincentive compensation processes.\\n \\nRisk governance framework\\nThe Firm’s risk governance framework involves \\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of \\nrisks.\\n \\nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers \\nof risks include, but are not limited to, the economic \\nenvironment, regulatory or government policy, competitor \\nor market evolution, business decisions, process or \\njudgment error, deli\\nberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional \\nmarkets, and natural disasters.\\nTypes of risks are categories by which risks manifest \\nthemselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized in \\nthe following four risk types:\\n \\n• Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity, or \\nreputation associated with poorly designed or failed \\nbusiness plans or an inadequate response to changes in \\nthe operating environment.\\n \\n• Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the \\ndefault or change in credit profile of a client, \\ncounterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a \\nreduction in expected returns on investments, including \\nconsumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and \\ninvestment portfolio risk.\\n \\n• Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of \\nchanges in market factors, such as interest and foreign \\nexchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit \\nspreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and \\nliabilities held for both the short and long term.\\n \\n• Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome \\nresulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or \\nsystems; human factors; or external events impacting the \\nFirm’s processes or systems.\\n Operational risk includes \\ncybersecurity, compliance, conduct, legal, and \\nestimations and model risk.\\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative \\nand qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks \\nmanifesting, including quantitative impacts such as a \\nreduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and \\nfines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to \\nthe Firm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers, and \\nregulatory and enforcement actions.\\nThe Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on a \\nFirmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk \\nManagement (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of Risk \\nManagement and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief Executive \\nOfficer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by the Risk \\nCommittee of the Board of Directors (the “Board Risk \\nCommittee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead \\nthe IRM function and maintain the risk governance \\nframework of the Firm. The framework is subject to \\napproval by the Board Risk Committee through its review \\nand approval of the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy. \\nThe Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to the \\nFirmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk Officers of \\nthe LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and the Firm’s Chief \\nCompliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in turn, establish Risk \\nManagement and Compliance organizations, develop the \\nFirm’s risk governance policies and standards, and define \\nand oversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk \\ngovernance framework.

The Office of the \\nComptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") establishes similar \\nminimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s \\nprincipal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. \\ncapital requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of \\nthe Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.\\nBasel III Overview\\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital \\nratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and \\ninternationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the \\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount \\nof regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is \\ndetermined by calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet \\nassets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according \\nto risk. Under the rules currently in effect, two \\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating \\nRWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), \\nand an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). \\nFor each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital \\nadequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the \\nStandardized or Advanced approaches compared to their \\nrespective regulatory capital ratio requirements.\\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC \\nreleased a proposal to amend the risk-based capital \\nframework, entitled \"Regulatory capital rule: Amendments \\napplicable to large banking organizations and to banking \\norganizations with significant trading activity,\" which is \\nreferred to in this Form 10-K as “U.S. Basel III proposal”. \\nUnder the proposal, changes to the framework would \\ninclude replacement of the Advanced approach with an \\nexpanded risk-based approach, which would not permit the \\nuse of internal models for the calculation of RWA, other \\nthan for market risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer \\nrequirement would be applicable to both the expanded risk-\\nbased approach and the Standardized approach. The \\nproposal would significantly revise risk-based capital \\nrequirements for all banks with assets of $100 billion or \\nmore, including the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. The \\nproposed effective date is July 1, 2025, with a three-year \\ntransition period applicable to the expanded risk-based \\napproach. Based on the Firm\\'s understanding of the \\nproposal, as applied to its Consolidated balance sheets as of \\nJune 30, 2023 (the reference date for a special data \\ncollection exercise conducted by the Federal Reserve), the \\nestimated impact at the end of the transition period would \\nincrease RWA by approximately 30%, which would result in \\nan approximately 25% increase to CET1 capital necessary \\nto meet the Firm’s CET1 ratio requirement, all else equal. \\nThese estimates do not reflect any actions that the Firm \\nmay take to mitigate the impact of the rule as currently \\nproposed.\\nPending the finalization of the U.S. Basel III proposal, the \\nFirm expects that it will continue to build capital above the \\ncurrent levels, and therefore the CET1 target of 13.5% \\npreviously set by the Firm (which was with respect to the \\ncurrent Standardized RWA measure) is no longer \\nmeaningful. The Firm\\'s quarterly capital ratios will vary \\ndependent on market conditions and other factors. Under \\nthe requirements of the U.S. Basel III proposal, the new \\nexpanded risk-based approach, when fully phased-in, would \\nbe the Firm’s binding constraint.\\nThe current Basel III rules establish capital requirements for \\ncalculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the \\ncase of Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key \\ndifferences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between \\nthe Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for \\nBasel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive \\napproaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit \\nmodels and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, \\ncredit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-\\nweightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and \\nasset class.

Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm’s \\ncontractual financial obligations are met and take into \\nconsideration: \\n• Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured \\nfunding markets; \\n• Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash outflows;\\n• Credit rating downgrades; \\n• Collateral haircuts; and \\n• Potential impediments to the availability and \\ntransferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and \\nmaterial legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other \\nrestrictions. \\nLiquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time \\nhorizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both \\nmarket and idiosyncratic stresses. \\nResults of stress tests are considered in the formulation of \\nthe Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity \\nposition.

The fair value of these securities was \\napproximately $649 billion and $694 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, although the \\namount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular \\ntime would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. \\nThe decrease compared to December 31, 2022, was driven \\nby a reduction in excess eligible HQLA securities at \\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., partially offset by an increase \\nin unencumbered AFS securities. \\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm had \\napproximately $1.4 trillion of available cash and securities \\ncomprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the \\nimpact of regulatory haircuts of $798.0 billion and $735.5 \\nbillion, respectively, and unencumbered marketable \\nsecurities with a fair value of approximately $649 billion \\nand $694 billion, respectively.\\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the \\nFederal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount \\nwindow at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of \\ncollateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of \\napproximately $340 billion and $323 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This borrowing \\ncapacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities \\nreported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered \\nsecurities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve \\nBanks discount window and other central banks. Available \\nborrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2022 \\nprimarily due to a higher amount of wholesale loans \\npledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, \\nthe Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the \\nFederal Reserve Banks discount window and the other \\ncentral banks as a primary source of liquidity.\\nNSFR\\nThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity \\nrequirement for large banking organizations that is \\nintended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable \\nfunding that is sufficient to meet their “required” amounts \\nof stable funding over a one-year horizon.  \\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2023, both the \\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with \\nthe 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm’s \\ninterpretation of the final rule.

The \\nFirm provides credit to a variety of clients and customers, \\nranging from large corporate and institutional clients to \\nindividual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer \\nbusinesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily \\nthrough its home lending, credit card, auto, and business \\nbanking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is \\nexposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, \\nmarket-making, and hedging activities with and for clients \\nand counterparties, as well as through its operating services \\nactivities (such as cash management and clearing \\nactivities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is \\nalso exposed to credit risk through its investment securities \\nportfolio and cash placed with banks.\\nCredit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages \\ncredit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk \\npolicies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk management \\ngovernance includes the following activities:\\n• Maintaining a credit risk policy framework\\n• Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across \\nall portfolio segments, including transaction and \\nexposure approval\\n• Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as \\nappropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines \\n• Assigning and managing credit approval authorities in \\nconnection with the approval of credit exposure\\n• Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and\\n• Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate \\ncredit risk-based capital management\\nRisk identification and measurement\\nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several \\nmethodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or \\ncounterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit \\nrisk vary depending on several factors, including type of \\nasset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement \\nparameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit \\nscore versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management \\nand collection processes (e.g., retail collection center \\nversus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk \\nmeasurement is based on the probability of default of an \\nobligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default \\nevent and the exposure at default.\\nBased on these factors and the methodology and estimates \\ndescribed in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit \\nlosses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses \\nreflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and \\nwholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the \\nallowance for lending-related commitments reflects \\nestimated credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related \\ncommitments and the allowance for investment securities \\nreflects estimated credit losses related to the investment \\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical \\nAccounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 155–158 \\nfor further information.\\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are \\nreflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and \\nrepresent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to \\nthe established allowances for loan losses and lending-\\nrelated commitments. The analyses for these losses include \\nstress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios \\nas described below.\\nStress testing\\nStress testing is important in measuring and managing \\ncredit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress testing \\nprocess assesses the potential impact of alternative \\neconomic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses \\nfor the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying \\nparameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of \\nmacroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. \\nThe stress test results may indicate credit migration, \\nchanges in delinquency trends and potential losses in the \\ncredit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing \\nprocesses, management also considers additional stresses \\noutside these scenarios, including industry and country- \\nspecific stress scenarios, as appropriate. The Firm uses \\nstress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite \\nboth at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact \\nof stress on individual counterparties.\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 111'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 149, 'page_label': '112'}, page_content='Risk monitoring and management\\nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that are \\ndesigned to preserve the independence and integrity of the \\napproval and decision-making process for extending credit \\nso that credit risks are assessed accurately, approved \\nproperly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both \\nthe transaction and portfolio levels.

The \\ncontractual amounts of these financial instruments represent \\nthe maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw \\ndown on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its \\nobligations under these guarantees, and the clients \\nsubsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these \\ncontracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have \\nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired \\nwithout being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, \\nthe Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of \\nthese wholesale lending-related commitments is \\nrepresentative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure \\nor funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further \\ninformation on wholesale lending-related commitments.\\nReceivables from customers\\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment \\nmargin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that \\nare collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ \\nbrokerage accounts (including cash on deposit, and primarily \\nliquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). To \\nmanage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin \\nrequirements and monitors the required margin levels on an \\nongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash \\nor other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. \\nCredit risk arising from lending activities subject to collateral \\nmaintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors \\nsuch as the short-term nature of the activity, the fair value of \\ncollateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the \\nborrower’s obligation to provide, additional margin when the \\nfair value of the collateral declines. Because of these \\nmitigating factors, these receivables generally do not require \\nan allowance for credit losses. However, if in management’s \\njudgment, an allowance for credit losses is required, the Firm \\nestimates expected credit losses based on the value of the \\ncollateral and probability of borrower default. These \\nreceivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts \\nreceivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.\\nRefer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s \\naccounting policies for the allowance for credit losses.\\nDerivative contracts\\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk, \\nincluding credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in \\ninterest rates, foreign exchange and equities and \\ncommodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in \\norder to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage \\ncertain risks associated with net open risk positions from its \\nmarket-making activities, including the counterparty credit \\nrisk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses \\nderivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and \\nother market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty \\nand the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the \\ncredit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives, \\nthe Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative \\ncounterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such \\nas futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-\\ncleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the \\ncredit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks \\nto mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative \\ncontracts through the use of legally enforceable master \\nnetting arrangements and collateral agreements. The \\npercentage of the Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject \\nto collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot \\ntrades, which are not typically covered by collateral \\nagreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared \\ntrades that are settled daily — was approximately 87% at \\nboth December 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 5 for \\nadditional information on the Firm’s use of collateral \\nagreements and further discussion of derivative contracts, \\ncounterparties and settlement types.\\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the \\nConsolidated balance sheets was $54.9 billion and $70.9 \\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The \\ndecrease was primarily as a result of market movements. \\nDerivative receivables represent the fair value of the \\nderivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable \\nmaster netting agreements and the related cash collateral \\nheld by the Firm.\\nIn addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and other cash \\ncollateral that may be used as security when the fair value of \\nthe client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these \\npurposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with \\nthe definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the \\nLCR rule.\\nIn management’s view, the appropriate measure of current \\ncredit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, \\nwhich generally represents securities that do not qualify as \\nhigh quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of \\nthese additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are \\nsubject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and \\nlimited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for \\neach counterparty.\\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 \\ngovernment securities, other liquid government agency and \\nguaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity \\nsecurities) delivered by clients at the initiation of \\ntransactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that \\nhave a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm \\nhas agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the \\nreporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the \\nreceivables balances and is not included in the tables below, it \\nis available as security against potential exposure that could \\narise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts \\nmove in the Firm’s favor.

To \\ncapture this variability, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-\\nclient basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related \\ncredit loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and \\nAverage exposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate \\nnetting and collateral benefits, where applicable.\\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential \\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a \\ncounterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly \\nequivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the \\ntransaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm \\nfor setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior \\nmanagement reporting and derivatives exposure \\nmanagement.\\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of \\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a \\nbasis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan \\nexposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential \\ncredit loss than Peak and is used as an input for \\naggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and \\nother credit risk.\\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the \\nFirm’s derivative exposures, including the benefit of \\ncollateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total life of \\nthe derivative contract is used as the primary metric for \\npricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital \\nand CVA, as further described below. \\nThe fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables \\nincorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of \\ncounterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a \\ncounterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the \\ncredit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk \\nmanagement is essential to controlling the dynamic credit \\nrisk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk \\nmanagement process for derivatives exposures takes into \\nconsideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which \\nis broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a \\ncounterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a \\ndefault by the same counterparty, which could cause \\nexposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s \\ncapacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors \\nmay influence the nature and magnitude of these \\ncorrelations over time. To the extent that these correlations \\nare identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with \\na particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages \\nexposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit \\nderivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign \\nexchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts.\\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s \\nc\\nurrent derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as \\ncalculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics.

The Firm \\nhas a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating \\nRisk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.\\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using historical \\nsimulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The \\nframework’s approach assumes that historical changes in \\nmarket values are representative of the distribution of \\npotential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm \\nbelieves the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily \\nmeasure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management \\ndecisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with \\nother market risk measures, provides the appropriate \\ninformation needed to respond to risk events. \\nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a \\none-day holding period and an expected tail-loss \\nmethodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. \\nRisk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to \\nmeasure risk profiles and levels of diversification across \\nproduct types and is used for aggregating risks and \\nmonitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are \\nreported as appropriate to various groups including senior \\nmanagement, the Board Risk Committee and regulators.  \\nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are individual \\nVaR models that simulate historical market returns for \\nindividual risk factors and/or product types. To capture \\nmaterial market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management \\nframework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are \\nperformed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to \\nmarket risk. These VaR models are granular and \\nincorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate \\ndaily changes in market values over the historical period; \\ninputs are selected based on the risk profile of each \\nportfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to \\ngenerate daily market values may be different across \\nproduct types or risk management systems. The VaR model \\nresults across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm \\nlevel.\\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect \\nmeasure of market risk exposure and potential future \\nlosses. In addition, based on their reliance on available \\nhistorical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, \\nVaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to \\nmeasure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly \\nthose associated with market illiquidity and sudden or \\nsevere shifts in market conditions. \\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not \\ncaptured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability \\nof appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to \\nestimate the VaR for these and other products when daily \\ntime series are not available. It is likely that using an actual \\nprice-based time series for these products, if available, \\nwould affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore \\nconsiders other nonstatistical measures such as stress \\ntesting, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its \\nmarket risk positions. \\nAs VaR model calculations require daily data and a \\nconsistent source for valuation, the daily market data used \\nmay be different than the independent third-party data \\ncollected for VCG price testing in its monthly valuation \\nprocess.

While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to \\nadverse changes in markets using recent historical market \\nbehavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from \\nhypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive \\npositions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures \\nthe Firm’s vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed \\nbut possible economic and market scenarios. The results \\nare used to understand the exposures responsible for those \\npotential losses and are measured against limits. \\nThe Firm’s stress framework covers market risk sensitive \\npositions in the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used \\nto calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both \\nmarket rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant \\nchanges in market factors such as credit spreads, equity \\nprices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, \\nand combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of \\nhypothetical economic and market scenarios.  \\nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail \\nevents in specific asset classes and geographies, including \\nhow the event may impact multiple market factors \\nsimultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific \\nidiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different \\nproducts. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the \\nFirm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes \\nagainst possible future stress events. Stress testing results \\nare reported periodically to senior management of the \\nFirm, as appropriate. \\nStress scenarios are governed by the overall stress \\nframework, under the oversight of Market Risk \\nManagement, and the models to calculate the stress results \\nare subject to the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk \\nManagement Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress \\nMethodology Committee reviews and approves changes to \\nstress testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm. \\nSignificant changes to the framework are escalated to \\nsenior management, as appropriate.  \\nThe Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating \\nthe Firm’s CCAR and other stress test results, which are \\nreported periodically to the Board of Directors. In addition, \\nstress testing results are incorporated into the Firm’s Risk \\nAppetite framework, and are reported periodically to the \\nBoard Risk Committee. \\nProfit and loss drawdowns \\nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading \\nlosses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and \\nloss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date \\npeak level.\\nStructural interest rate risk management \\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported \\nnet income is important as interest rate risk represents one \\nof the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk \\narises not only from trading activities which are included in \\nVaR, but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, \\nwhich include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking \\ndeposits, issuing debt, as well as the investment securities \\nportfolio, and associated derivative instruments. Refer to \\nthe table on page 136 for a summary by LOB and Corporate \\nidentifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.\\nGovernance\\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s interest rate \\nrisk management policy and related limits, which are \\nsubject to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury \\nand CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates \\nthe Firm’s structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it \\nwith senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee. \\nIn addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is \\nmanaged through a dedicated risk function reporting to the \\nCTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing \\nindependent oversight and governance around assumptions \\nand establishing and monitoring limits for structural \\ninterest rate risk, including limits related to Earnings-at-\\nRisk and Economic Value Sensitivity. The Firm manages \\nstructural interest rate risk generally through its investment \\nsecurities portfolio and interest rate derivatives.\\nKey Risk Drivers and Risk Management Process\\nStructural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of \\nfactors, including:\\n• Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of \\nassets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments\\n• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-\\nbalance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing \\nat the same time\\n• Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-\\nterm market interest rates change (for example, changes \\nin the slope of the yield curve)\\n• The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, \\nliabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest \\nrates change\\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its \\nassets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. \\nBusiness units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury \\nand CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into \\naccount the elements of interest rate exposure that can be \\nrisk-managed in financial markets. These elements include \\nasset and liability balances and contractual rates of \\ninterest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected \\nprepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and \\nmaturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest \\nrate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.\\nEarnings-at-Risk\\nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate \\nrisk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates \\nthe Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate \\nscenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which \\nincludes net interest income and certain interest rate \\nsensitive fees.

Refer to non-U.S. \\ndollar foreign exchange risk on page 145 for more \\ninformation.\\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to \\na net interest income baseline over the following 12 months \\nutilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a \\nparallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-\\nterm rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve \\ninvolving holding short-term rates constant and increasing \\nlong-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving \\nincreasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates \\nconstant or holding short-term rates constant and \\ndecreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many \\ndifferent factors, including: \\n• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous \\nchanges in interest rates from baseline rates.\\n• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled \\nprepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding \\nassumptions about actions that could be taken by the \\nFirm or its clients and customers in response to \\ninstantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment \\nassumptions are based on the interest rates used in the \\nscenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, \\nthe time since origination, and other factors which are \\nupdated periodically based on historical experience. \\nDeposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm’s \\nearnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain \\nassumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative \\nEasing that are highly uncertain and require management \\njudgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held \\nby the Firm at any particular time could be impacted by \\nactions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary \\npolicy, including through the use of the Reverse \\nRepurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors \\nthat impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such \\nas the level of loans across the industry and competition \\nfor deposits.\\n• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit \\nbetas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid \\ncould change upon a given change in market interest \\nrates. As part of the Firm's continuous evaluation and \\nperiodic enhancements to its earnings-at-risk \\ncalculations, the Firm updated its model in the second \\nquarter of 2023 to incorporate deposit repricing lags \\nimpacting both consumer and wholesale deposits. The \\nmodel change incorporated observed pricing and \\ncustomer behavior in both rising and falling interest rate \\nenvironments. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from \\nthe modeled assumptions, primarily due to customer \\nbehavior and competition for deposits.\\nThe Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the assumptions \\nused in earnings-at-risk scenarios, including with respect to \\ndeposit betas and forecasts of deposit balances, both of \\nwhich are especially significant in the case of consumer \\ndeposits.

The Control Management \\nOrganization, which consists of control managers within \\neach LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day \\nexecution of the CCOR Framework. \\nThe Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE \\nfor Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is \\nresponsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework \\nand establishing the minimum standards for its execution. \\nThe LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report \\nto the Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and \\nQualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of the \\nrespective businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR \\nManagement Framework is included in the Risk Governance \\nand Oversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the \\nBoard Risk Committee periodically.\\nOperational Risk Identification\\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-\\nassessment process that is executed by the LOBs and \\nCorporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate \\nevaluate the effectiveness of their respective control \\nenvironment to assess circumstances in which controls have \\nfailed, and to determine where remediation efforts may be \\nrequired. The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance \\norganization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”) provides \\noversight of and challenge to these evaluations and may \\nalso perform independent assessments of significant \\noperational risk events and areas of concentrated or \\nemerging risk.\\nOperational Risk Measurement\\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an independent \\nassessment of the operational risks inherent within the \\nLOBs and Corporate, which includes evaluating the \\neffectiveness of the control environments and reporting the \\nresults to senior management.\\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses \\noperational risks through quantitative means, including \\noperational risk-based capital and estimation of operational \\nrisk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions. \\nThe primary component of the operational risk-based \\ncapital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) \\nstatistical model, which simulates the projected frequency \\nand severity of operational risk losses based on historical \\ndata. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate \\noperational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a \\n99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual \\ninternal operational risk losses in the quarter following the \\nperiod in which those losses were realized, and the \\ncalculation generally continues to reflect such losses even \\nafter the issues or business activities giving rise to the \\nlosses have been remediated or reduced.\\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the \\nFirm’s operational risk capital methodology, which uses the \\nAdvanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), incorporates \\ninternal and external losses as well as management’s view \\nof tail risk captured through operational risk scenario \\nanalysis, and evaluation of key business environment and \\ninternal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the \\nimpact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk \\ncapital. \\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic \\nconditions on operational risk losses and develops a \\nforward looking view of material operational risk events \\nthat may occur in a stressed environment.

The \\nFirm’s most complex accounting estimates require \\nmanagement’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate \\ncarrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has \\nestablished policies and control procedures intended to \\nensure that estimation methods, including any judgments \\nmade as part of such methods, are well-controlled, \\nindependently reviewed and applied consistently from \\nperiod to period. The methods used and judgments made \\nreflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or \\nliabilities and the related business and risk management \\nstrategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and \\nportfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are \\nintended to ensure that the process for changing \\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm \\nbelieves its estimates for determining the carrying value of \\nits assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a \\nbrief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates \\ninvolving significant judgments.\\nAllowance for credit losses\\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents \\nmanagement’s estimate of expected credit losses over the \\nremaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets \\nmeasured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet \\nlending-related commitments. The allowance for credit \\nlosses generally comprises:\\n• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s \\nretained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),\\n• The allowance for lending-related commitments and\\n• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.\\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant \\njudgment on a number of matters including development \\nand weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of \\nhistorical loss experience, assessment of risk \\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of \\ncollateral, and the determination of remaining expected \\nlife. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information \\non these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and \\nmethodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for \\ncredit losses.\\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in \\nestimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to \\nthe macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses \\nover the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s \\nmethodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates \\nhundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are \\nrelevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit \\nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty \\nvariables. The specific variables that have the greatest \\neffect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by \\nportfolio and geography.\\n• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. \\nunemployment rates and U.S. HPI.\\n• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. \\nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. \\ninterest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil prices, \\nU.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S. HPI.\\nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of \\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of \\nexpected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet \\ndate or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one \\nreporting period to the next.\\nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm \\nrecorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans \\nacquired and lending-related commitments assumed as of \\nMay 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk rating \\nmethodologies for the First Republic portfolio, and the \\nongoing integration of products and systems, the allowance \\nfor credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was \\nmeasured based on other facilities underwritten by the Firm \\nwith similar risk characteristics and not based on modeled \\nestimates. As such, the First Republic wholesale portfolio is \\nexcluded from the modeled estimates sensitivity analysis \\nbelow. The allowance for credit losses for predominantly all \\nof the consumer portfolio was measured using the Firm’s \\nmodeled approach, as the consumer portfolio is \\npredominantly residential real estate that has more \\ncommonly defined risk characteristics including loan to \\nvalue ratio and credit score, and therefore is reflected in \\nthe sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 34 for \\nadditional information on the First Republic acquisition. \\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one \\nfactor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit \\nlosses because management considers a wide variety of \\nfactors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit \\nlosses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may \\nnot occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across \\nall geographies or product types, and changes in factors \\nand inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that \\nimprovement in one factor or input may offset deterioration \\nin others.\\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate \\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled \\ncredit losses determined using its central and relative \\nadverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five \\nscenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan \\nlosses and lending-related commitments. The central and \\nrelative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of \\nMEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of \\nthose variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.  \\nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario \\nshown on page 131 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative \\nadverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment \\nrate, averaging approximately 2.1% higher over the eight-\\nquarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately \\n2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2024; lower U.S. real GDP \\nwith a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3.3% lower at the \\nend of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of \\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 155'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 193, 'page_label': '156'}, page_content='approximately 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024; and \\nlower HPI with a peak difference of approximately 17.9% in \\nthe third quarter of 2025.\\nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected future \\nchanges in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of \\nreasons, including:\\n• The allowance as of December 31, 2023, reflects credit \\nlosses beyond those estimated under the central scenario \\ndue to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.\\n• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both \\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis \\ncannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes \\nin macroeconomic variables. \\n• Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition \\nand borrower behavior can significantly affect the \\nallowance for credit losses.\\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to \\nmacroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2023, the \\nFirm compared the modeled estimates under its relative \\nadverse scenario to its central scenario.

Estimating fair value requires the \\napplication of judgment. The type and level of judgment \\nrequired is largely dependent on the amount of observable \\nmarket information available to the Firm. For instruments \\nvalued using internally developed valuation models and \\nother valuation techniques that use significant \\nunobservable inputs and are therefore classified within \\nlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to \\nestimate fair value are more significant than those required \\nwhen estimating the fair value of instruments classified \\nwithin levels 1 and 2.\\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument \\nwithin level 3, management must first determine the \\nappropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to \\nuse. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant \\ninputs requires management to assess relevant empirical \\ndata in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, \\ntransaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment \\nspeeds, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such \\nas commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of \\ncomparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit \\ncurves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the \\nvaluation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable \\ninputs used.\\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management \\njudgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of \\nvaluation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, \\nthe Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity \\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios \\nthat meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk \\nposition. The judgments made are typically affected by the \\ntype of product and its specific contractual terms, and the \\nlevel of liquidity for the product or within the market as a \\nwhole. In periods of heightened market volatility and \\nuncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider \\nvariation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for \\npositions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further \\ndiscussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.\\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or \\nother factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded \\nfor a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm \\nbelieves its valuation methods are appropriate and \\nconsistent with those of other market participants, the \\nmethods and assumptions used reflect management \\njudgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and \\nportfolios.\\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in \\nthe determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or \\nassumptions different than those used by the Firm could \\nresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting \\ndate. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s \\nvaluation process and hierarchy, and its determination of \\nfair value for individual financial instruments.\\nGoodwill impairment \\nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting \\nunits and tested for impairment at least annually. The \\nFirm’s process and methodology used to conduct goodwill \\nimpairment testing is described in Note 15.\\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing \\ngoodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each \\nbusiness combination is allocated to the related reporting \\nunits for goodwill impairment testing.\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Firm reviewed \\ncurrent economic conditions, estimated market cost of \\nequity, as well as actual business results and projections of \\nbusiness performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has \\nconcluded that goodwill was not impaired as of \\nDecember 31, 2023. For each of the reporting units, fair \\nvalue exceeded carrying value by at least 9% and there was \\nno indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment \\nbased on current projections and valuations. \\nThe projections for the Firm’s reporting units are consistent \\nwith management’s current business outlook assumptions \\nin the short term, and the Firm’s best estimates of long-\\nterm growth and return on equity in the longer term. Where \\npossible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to \\nbenchmark its assumptions and estimates.\\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, \\nincluding the goodwill impairment assessment as of \\nDecember 31, 2023.\\nCredit card rewards liability\\nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards \\nprograms which allow cardholders to earn rewards points \\nbased on their account activity and the terms and \\nconditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no \\nlimits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor \\ndo the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a \\nvariety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the \\nform of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm \\nmaintains a rewards liability which represents the \\nestimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be \\nredeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the \\ncardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the \\ncardholder redeems points. This liability was $13.2 billion \\nand $11.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other \\nliabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase \\nin the liability was predominantly driven by continued \\ngrowth in rewards points earned on higher spend and \\npromotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout \\n2023, and, to a lesser extent, adjustments to certain \\nreward program terms in the second quarter of 2023.\\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (“RR”) \\nand cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR assumption \\nis used to estimate the number of points earned by \\ncustomers that will be redeemed over the life of the \\naccount. The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of \\nfuture point redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated \\nperiodically considering historical actuals, cardholder \\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 157'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 195, 'page_label': '158'}, page_content='redemption behavior and management judgment. Updates \\nto these assumptions will impact the rewards liability. As of \\nDecember 31, 2023, a combined increase of 25 basis \\npoints in RR and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the \\nrewards liability by approximately $376 million.\\nIncome taxes \\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the \\nvarious jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. \\nfederal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These \\nlaws are often complex and may be subject to different \\ninterpretations. To determine the financial statement \\nimpact of accounting for income taxes, including the \\nprovision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax \\nbenefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and \\njudgments about how to interpret and apply these complex \\ntax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as \\nwell as make judgments regarding the timing of when \\ncertain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and \\nnon-U.S. tax jurisdictions.\\nJPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the \\nworld are subject to review and examination by the various \\ntaxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm \\noperates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a \\ntax position. These disputes over interpretations with the \\nvarious taxing authorities may be settled by audit, \\nadministrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems \\nof the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. \\nJPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be \\nassessed additional income taxes as a result of the \\nresolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional \\nunrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the \\nFirm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes \\nin income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business \\nstrategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate \\nof income taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of \\noperations in any reporting period.\\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between assets and \\nliabilities measured for financial reporting versus income \\ntax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, \\nin management’s judgment, their realizability is determined \\nto be more likely than not. Deferred taxes are measured \\nusing enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income \\nin the years in which those temporary differences are \\nexpected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred \\ntaxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the \\nprovision for income taxes in the period enacted.\\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in \\nconnection with certain tax attributes, including net \\noperating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit \\n(“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews \\nto ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. \\nThese reviews include management’s estimates and \\nassumptions regarding future taxable income, including \\nforeign source income, and may incorporate various tax \\nplanning strategies, including strategies that may be \\navailable to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In \\nconnection with these reviews, if it is determined that a \\ndeferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is \\nestablished. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a \\nsubsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, \\nbased on revised estimates of future taxable income or \\nchanges in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not \\nthat all or part of the deferred tax asset will become \\nrealizable. As of December 31, 2023, management has \\ndetermined it is more likely than not that the Firm will \\nrealize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation \\nallowance.\\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary \\nwhen new information becomes available, including \\nchanges in tax law and regulations, and interactions with \\ntaxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet the \\nmore-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to \\ndetermine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain \\ntax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit \\nthat management believes is more likely than not to be \\nrealized upon settlement. It is possible that the \\nreassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax \\nbenefits may have a material impact on its effective income \\ntax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs. \\nAlthough the Firm believes that its estimates are \\nreasonable, the final tax amount could be different from the \\namounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax provisions and \\naccruals. To the extent that the final outcome of these \\namounts is different than the amounts recorded, such \\ndifferences will generally impact the Firm’s provision for \\nincome taxes in the period in which such a determination is \\nmade.\\nThe Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of \\ncurrent and deferred taxes. The current and deferred tax \\nprovisions are calculated based on estimates and \\nassumptions that could differ from the actual results \\nreflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent \\nyear. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally \\nrecorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and \\nthe global tax implications are known, which could impact \\nthe Firm’s effective tax rate.\\nRefer to Note 25 for additional information on income \\ntaxes.\\nLitigation reserves \\nRefer to Note 30 for a description of the significant \\nestimates and judgments associated with establishing \\nlitigation reserves.\\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\\n158 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 196, 'page_label': '159'}, page_content='ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS\\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards Adopted since January 1, 2021\\nStandard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements\\nReference Rate\\nReform\\nIssued March\\n2020 and updated \\nJanuary 2021 and \\nDecember 2022\\n• Provides optional expedients and exceptions to \\ncurrent accounting guidance when financial \\ninstruments, hedge accounting relationships, and \\nother transactions are amended due to reference \\nrate reform.\\n• Issued and effective March 12, 2020.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the \\nFirm’s consolidated financial statements and on the Firm’s \\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. \\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public \\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to \\nthe Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws \\nand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities \\nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of \\nthe PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about \\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of \\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and \\nwhether effective internal control over financial reporting \\nwas maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included \\nperforming procedures to assess the risks of material \\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, \\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures \\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included \\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts \\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our \\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles \\nused and significant estimates made by management, as \\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the \\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an \\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, \\nassessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and \\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating \\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. \\nOur audits also included performing such other procedures \\nas we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe \\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial \\nReporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a \\nprocess designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding \\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of \\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance \\nwith generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s \\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those \\npolicies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance \\nof records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly \\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the \\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that \\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit \\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts \\nand expenditures of the company are being made only in \\naccordance with authorizations of management and \\ndirectors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable \\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of \\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the \\ncompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the \\nfinancial statements. \\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over \\nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect \\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of \\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that \\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in \\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the \\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  \\x9f  300 Madison Avenue  \\x9f  New York, NY 10017\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 163'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 201, 'page_label': '164'}, page_content=\"Critical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters \\narising from the current period audit of the consolidated \\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required \\nto be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) \\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the \\nconsolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our \\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. \\nThe communication of critical audit matters does not alter \\nin any way our opinion on the consolidated financial \\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by \\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing \\nseparate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the \\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\\nAllowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based component of \\nWholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios \\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial \\nstatements, the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-\\nbased component of the wholesale and credit card loan \\nportfolios was $20.2 billion on total portfolio-based \\nretained loans of $881.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The \\nFirm’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s \\nestimate of expected credit losses over the remaining \\nexpected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers \\nexpected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The \\nportfolio-based component of the Firm’s allowance for loan \\nlosses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan \\nportfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of expected \\ncredit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying \\ncredit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The \\ncredit loss factors applied are determined based on the \\nweighted average of five internally developed \\nmacroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the \\nFirm's economic outlook as derived through forecast \\nmacroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are \\nU.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. \\nThis quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into \\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk \\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that are \\nnot yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that \\nperforming procedures relating to the allowance for loan \\nlosses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale \\nand credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are \\n(i) the significant judgment and estimation by management \\nin the forecast of macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. \\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the \\nFirm’s forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect \\nits estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet \\ndate, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by \\nmanagement in determining the quantitative calculation \\nutilized in their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to \\ntake into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk \\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that are \\nnot yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate, \\nwhich both in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, \\nsubjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in \\nevaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit \\nloss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments \\nto the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort \\ninvolved the use of professionals with specialized skill and \\nknowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and \\nevaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our \\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. \\nThese procedures included testing the effectiveness of \\ncontrols relating to the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, \\nincluding controls over model validation and generation of \\nmacroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included, \\namong others, testing management’s process for estimating \\nthe allowance for loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating \\nthe appropriateness of the models and methodologies used \\nin quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the \\nreasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. \\nreal gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness \\nand accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) \\nevaluating the reasonableness of management’s \\nadjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts of \\nmodel imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and \\nother subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected \\nin the credit loss estimate. These procedures also included \\nthe use of professionals with specialized skill and \\nknowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of \\ncertain models, methodologies and macroeconomic \\nvariables.\\nFair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial \\nstatements, the Firm carries $1.1 trillion of its assets and \\n$541.4 billion of its liabilities at fair value on a recurring \\nbasis. Included in these balances are $11.3 billion of \\ntrading assets and $42.2 billion of liabilities measured at \\nfair value on a recurring basis, collectively financial \\ninstruments, which are classified as level 3 as they contain \\none or more inputs to valuation which are unobservable \\nand significant to their fair value measurement. The Firm \\nutilized internally developed valuation models and \\nunobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the level 3 \\nfinancial instruments. The unobservable inputs used by \\nmanagement to estimate the fair value of certain of these \\nfinancial instruments include interest rate volatility, interest \\nrate spread volatility, Bermudan switch value, and \\ncorrelation relating to interest rates, interest rate-to-\\nforeign exchange, equity prices, equity-to-foreign exchange, \\nequity-to-interest rate and credit.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that \\nperforming procedures relating to the fair value of certain \\nlevel 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) \\nthe significant judgment and estimation by management in \\ndetermining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn \\nled to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and \\neffort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit \\nevidence obtained related to the fair value of these financial \\ninstruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of \\nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\n164 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 202, 'page_label': '165'}, page_content='Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and \\nevaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our \\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. \\nThese procedures included testing the effectiveness of \\ncontrols relating to the Firm’s determination of the fair \\nvalue, including controls over models, inputs, and data. \\nThese procedures also included, among others, the \\ninvolvement of professionals with specialized skill and \\nknowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate \\nof fair value for a sample of these financial instruments and \\ncomparing management’s estimate to the independently \\ndeveloped estimate of fair value.

(“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a \\nfinancial holding company incorporated under Delaware law \\nin 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the \\nU.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in \\ninvestment banking, financial services for consumers and \\nsmall businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction \\nprocessing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, \\nJPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed \\ncertain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the “First Republic \\nacquisition”) from the Federal Deposit Insurance \\nCorporation (“FDIC”). The Firm continues to convert certain \\noperations, and to integrate clients, products and services \\nassociated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with \\nthe Firm’s businesses and operations. Accordingly, \\nreporting classification and internal risk rating profiles in \\nthe wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer \\nto Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic \\nacquisition.\\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan \\nChase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. \\nAdditionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the \\naccounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by \\nregulatory authorities.\\nConsolidation\\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts \\nof JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has \\na controlling financial interest. All material intercompany \\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by \\nthe Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not \\nincluded on the Consolidated balance sheets.\\nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial \\ninterest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is \\na voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. \\nVoting interest entities\\nVoting interest entities are entities that have sufficient \\nequity and provide the equity investors voting rights that \\nenable them to make significant decisions relating to the \\nentity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s \\ndetermination of whether it has a controlling interest is \\nprimarily based on the amount of voting equity interests \\nheld. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial \\ninterest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ \\nvoting equity interests, or through other contractual rights \\nthat give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm.\\nInvestments in companies in which the Firm has significant \\ninfluence over operating and financing decisions (but does \\nnot own a majority of the voting equity interests) are \\naccounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of \\naccounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was \\nelected. These investments are generally included in other \\nassets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue.\\nCertain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are \\nstructured as limited partnerships or limited liability \\ncompanies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the \\ngeneral partner or managing member, but the non-\\naffiliated partners or members have the ability to remove \\nthe Firm as the general partner or managing member \\nwithout cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple \\nmajority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members \\nhave rights to participate in important decisions. \\nAccordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting \\ninterest entities. However, in the limited cases where the \\nnon-managing partners or members do not have \\nsubstantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm \\nevaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if \\nthe Firm is the general partner or managing member and \\nhas both power and a potentially significant interest. \\nThe Firm’s investment companies and asset management \\nfunds have investments in both publicly-held and privately-\\nheld entities, including investments in buyouts, growth \\nequity and venture opportunities. These investments are \\naccounted for under investment company guidelines and, \\naccordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity \\nownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated \\nbalance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other \\nassets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. \\nIf consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such \\nspecialized investment company guidelines.\\nVariable interest entities \\nVIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient \\nequity to permit the entity to finance its activities without \\nadditional subordinated financial support from other \\nparties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the \\nability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s \\noperations through voting rights, or do not have the \\nobligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the \\nright to receive the residual returns of the entity.\\nThe most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly \\nused in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain \\nassets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to \\ninvestors. The basic SPE structure involves a company \\nselling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of \\nthose assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal \\ndocuments that govern the transaction specify how the cash \\nearned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s \\ninvestors and other parties that have rights to those cash \\nflows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors \\nfrom claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other \\nentities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets. \\nThe primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a \\ncontrolling financial interest) is required to consolidate the \\nassets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is \\nthe party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities \\nof the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic \\nperformance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the \\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 171'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 209, 'page_label': '172'}, page_content='obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits \\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\\nTo assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the \\nactivities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s \\neconomic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and \\ncircumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and \\nits ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment \\nincludes, first, identifying the activities that most \\nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and \\nsecond, identifying which party, if any, has power over \\nthose activities.

The Firm has \\nelected to net such balances where it has determined that \\nthe specified conditions are met.\\nThe Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate \\ncounterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including \\nderivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities \\nborrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master \\nnetting agreement is a single agreement with a \\ncounterparty that permits multiple transactions governed \\nby that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and \\nsettled through a single payment in a single currency in the \\nevent of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a \\nrequired payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral \\nor margin when due).

This guidance also clarified the \\ntypes of derivatives that could be used as hedges, and the \\nbalance sheet presentation and disclosure requirements for \\nthe hedge accounting adjustments. As permitted by the \\nguidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS \\nand designated those securities in a portfolio layer method \\nhedge upon adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer \\non retained earnings was not material.\\nRefer to Note 5 and Note 10 for additional information.\\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled Debt \\nRestructurings (“TDRs”) \\nThe adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting \\nand disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the \\nrequirement to measure the allowance using a discounted \\ncash flow (“DCF”) methodology, and allowed the option of a \\nnon-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to \\ntroubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for \\nthese modified loans, the discount rate must be the post-\\nmodification effective interest rate, instead of the pre-\\nmodification effective interest rate. \\nThe Firm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based \\nallowance approach for modified loans to troubled \\nborrowers for all portfolios except collateral-dependent \\nloans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm \\nelected to continue applying a DCF methodology. Refer to \\nNote 13 for a description of the portfolio-based allowance \\napproach and the asset-specific allowance approach.\\nThis guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 under the \\nmodified retrospective method which resulted in a net \\ndecrease to the allowance for credit losses of $587 million \\nand an increase to retained earnings of $446 million, after-\\ntax, predominantly driven by residential real estate and \\ncredit card.\\nThe adoption of this guidance eliminated the disclosure \\nrequirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess \\nwhether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a \\nconcession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan \\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty \\nconsisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, \\nother-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a \\ncombination of these modifications.

These assets and liabilities are predominantly \\ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and \\nliabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on \\nthe Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, \\nliabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are \\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they \\nare not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are \\nsubject to fair value adjustments only in certain \\ncircumstances (for example, when there is evidence of \\nimpairment).\\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to \\nsell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \\ntransaction between market participants at the \\nmeasurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market \\nprices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not \\navailable, fair value is based on valuation models and other \\nvaluation techniques that consider relevant transaction \\ncharacteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, \\nobservable or unobservable market parameters, including \\nyield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as \\ncommodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign \\nexchange rates and credit curves. Fair value may also \\nincorporate valuation adjustments. \\nThe level of precision in estimating unobservable market \\ninputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss \\nrecorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the \\nFirm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and \\nconsistent with those of other market participants, the \\nmethods and assumptions used reflect management \\njudgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and \\nportfolios. \\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in \\nthe determination of fair value. The use of different \\nmethodologies or assumptions by other market participants \\ncompared with those used by the Firm could result in the \\nFirm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the \\nreporting date. \\nValuation process \\nRisk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair \\nvalue estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the \\nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s \\nValuation Control Group (“VCG”), which is part of the Firm’s \\nFinance function and independent of the risk-taking \\nfunctions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and \\ndetermining any fair value adjustments that may be \\nrequired to ensure that the Firm’s positions are recorded at \\nfair value. In addition, the Firm’s Valuation Governance \\nForum (“VGF”), which is composed of senior finance and \\nrisk executives, is responsible for overseeing the \\nmanagement of risks arising from valuation activities \\nconducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by \\nthe Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the \\nFirm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the \\nCIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including \\nTreasury and CIO. \\nPrice verification process \\nThe VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk-\\ntaking functions by leveraging independently derived \\nprices, valuation inputs and other market data, where \\navailable. Where independent prices or inputs are not \\navailable, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the \\nreasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may \\ninclude evaluating the limited market activity including \\nclient unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those \\nused for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of \\nstructured instruments into individual components, \\ncomparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit \\nand loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral \\nvaluation. There are also additional levels of management \\nreview for more significant or complex positions.\\nThe VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be \\nrequired to the estimates provided by the risk-taking \\nfunctions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for \\ninstruments classified within level 1 of the fair value \\nhierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further \\ninformation on the fair value hierarchy). For other \\npositions, judgment is required to assess the need for \\nvaluation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity \\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain \\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net \\nopen risk position. The determination of such adjustments \\nfollows a consistent framework across the Firm:\\n• Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an \\nobservable external price or valuation parameter exists \\nbut is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower \\nmarket activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are \\nmade based on current market conditions. Factors that \\nmay be considered in determining the liquidity \\nadjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-\\noffer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) \\nalternative pricing points for similar instruments in \\nactive markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values \\nthat the price or parameter could take. \\n• The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial \\ninstruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, \\nas permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the \\nfair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of \\nthe entire net open risk position in an orderly \\ntransaction. Where this is the case, valuation \\nadjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of \\nexiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk \\nposition. Where applied, such adjustments are based on \\nfactors that a relevant market participant would \\nconsider in the transfer of the net open risk position, \\nincluding the size of the adverse market move that is \\nlikely to occur during the period required to sufficiently \\nreduce the net open risk position. \\n• Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable \\nparameters may be made when positions are valued \\nusing prices or input parameters to valuation models \\nthat are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or \\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 175'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 213, 'page_label': '176'}, page_content='because they cannot be implied from observable market \\ndata.

In certain \\ncircumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s \\npolicy to allow a model to be used prior to review or \\napproval. MRGR may also require the user to take \\nappropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be \\nused in the interim. These actions will depend on the model \\nand may include, for example, limitation of trading activity. \\nFair value hierarchy \\nA three-level fair value hierarchy has been established \\nunder U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. \\nThe fair value hierarchy is based on the observability of \\ninputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the \\nmeasurement date. The three levels are defined as follows. \\n• Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are \\nquoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or \\nliabilities in active markets. \\n• Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include \\nquoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active \\nmarkets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or \\nliability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the \\nfull term of the financial instrument.\\n• Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation \\nmethodology are unobservable and significant to the fair \\nvalue measurement. \\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value \\nhierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is \\nsignificant to the fair value measurement.\\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\\n176 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 214, 'page_label': '177'}, page_content='The following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant products/\\ninstruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy. \\nProduct/instrument Valuation methodology\\nClassifications in the fair value  \\nhierarchy\\nSecurities financing agreements Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Predominantly level 2\\n•  Derivative features: refer to the discussion of derivatives below \\nfor further information\\n•  Market rates for the respective maturity\\n•  Collateral characteristics\\nLoans and lending-related \\ncommitments — wholesale\\nLoans carried at fair value\\n(trading loans and non-trading \\nloans) and associated\\nlending-related commitments\\nWhere observable market data is available, valuations are based on: Level 2 or 3\\n•  Observed market prices (circumstances are infrequent)\\n•  Relevant broker quotes\\n•  Observed market prices for similar instruments\\nWhere observable market data is unavailable or limited, valuations are \\nbased on discounted cash flows, which consider the following:\\n•  Credit spreads derived from the cost of CDS; or benchmark credit \\ncurves developed by the Firm, by industry and credit rating\\n•  Prepayment speed\\n•  Collateral characteristics\\nLoans — consumer Fair value is based on observable market prices for mortgage-backed \\nsecurities with similar collateral and incorporates adjustments to \\nthese prices to account for differences between the securities and the \\nvalue of the underlying loans, which include credit characteristics, \\nportfolio composition, and liquidity.\\nPredominantly level 2\\nLoans carried at fair value — \\nconforming residential \\nmortgage loans expected to be \\nsold\\nInvestment and trading \\nsecurities\\nQuoted market prices Level 1\\nIn the absence of quoted market prices, securities are valued based \\non:\\nLevel 2 or 3\\n•  Observable market prices for similar securities\\n•  Relevant broker quotes\\n•  Discounted cash flows\\nIn addition, the following inputs to discounted cash flows are used for \\nthe following products:\\nMortgage- and asset-backed securities specific inputs:\\n•  Collateral characteristics\\n•  Deal-specific payment and loss allocations\\n•  Current market assumptions related to yield, prepayment speed, \\nconditional default rates and loss severity\\nCollateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) specific inputs:\\n•  Collateral characteristics\\n•  Deal-specific payment and loss allocations\\n•  Expected prepayment speed, conditional default rates, loss \\nseverity\\n•  Credit spreads\\n•  Credit rating data\\nPhysical commodities Valued using observable market prices or data.

Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not \\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities \\ninventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities \\napproximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5\\n for a further \\ndiscussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have \\nbeen included in each period presented.\\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 181\\nFair value hierarchyFair value hierarchy'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 219, 'page_label': '182'}, page_content='(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be \\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy.

Refer to pages 175–179 of this Note for further \\ninformation on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed \\ndiscussion of the determination of fair value for individual \\nfinancial instruments. \\nEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment. \\nThe type and level of judgment required is largely dependent \\non the amount of observable market information available to \\nthe Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed \\nvaluation models and other valuation techniques that use \\nsignificant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified \\nwithin level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to \\nestimate fair value are more significant than those required \\nwhen estimating the fair value of instruments classified \\nwithin levels 1 and 2. \\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument \\nwithin level 3, management must first determine the \\nappropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to \\nuse. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant \\ninputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in \\nderiving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield \\ncurves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, \\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or \\ndebt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign \\nexchange rates and credit curves. \\nThe following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 \\nfinancial instruments, the valuation techniques used to \\nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, the \\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those \\ninputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such \\ninputs. While the determination to classify an instrument \\nwithin level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable \\ninputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial \\ninstruments typically include observable components (that is, \\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to \\nexternal sources) in addition to the unobservable \\ncomponents. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not \\nincluded in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk \\nof the observable components of level 3 financial instruments \\nusing securities and derivative positions that are classified \\nwithin levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. \\nThe range of values presented in the table is representative \\nof the highest and lowest level input used to value the \\nsignificant groups of instruments within a product/instrument \\nclassification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the \\ninput values presented in the table are calculated based on \\nthe fair value of the instruments that the input is being used \\nto value. \\nIn the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic \\naverage values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty \\nor an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s \\nestimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the \\ncharacteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm \\nand the relative distribution of instruments within the range \\nof characteristics. For example, two option contracts may \\nhave similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation \\nuncertainty, but may have significantly different implied \\nvolatility levels because the option contracts have different \\nunderlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and \\nweighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary \\nfrom period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on \\nthe characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at \\neach balance sheet date. \\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 183'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 221, 'page_label': '184'}, page_content='Level 3 inputs(a) \\nDecember 31, 2023\\nProduct/Instrument\\nFair value \\n(in millions)\\nPrincipal valuation \\ntechnique Unobservable inputs(g) Range of input values Average(i)\\nResidential mortgage-backed securities and \\nloans(b) $ 1,743 Discounted cash flows Yield 0% 72% 7%\\nPrepayment speed 3% 12% 9%\\nConditional default rate 0% 6% 0%\\nLoss severity 0% 110% 3%\\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities and \\nloans(c)\\n 1,460 Market comparables Price $0 $90 $80\\nCorporate debt securities  484 Market comparables Price $0 $242 $98\\nLoans(d)  1,335 Market comparables Price $0 $108 $79\\nNon-U.S. government debt securities  179 Market comparables Price $2 $109 $91\\nNet interest rate derivatives  495 Option pricing Interest rate volatility 25bps 420bps 117bps\\nInterest rate spread volatility 37bps 77bps 64bps\\nBermudan switch value 0% 54% 19%\\nInterest rate correlation (82)% 90% 19%\\nIR-FX correlation (35)% 60% 5%\\n 7 Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 0% 20% 5%\\nNet credit derivatives  233 Discounted cash flows Credit correlation 35% 70% 51%\\nCredit spread 0bps 3,617bps 384bps\\nRecovery rate 10% 90% 55%\\n 32 Market comparables Price $0 $115 $73\\nNet foreign exchange derivatives  128 Option pricing IR-FX correlation (40)% 60% 20%\\n (66) Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 11% 11%\\nInterest rate curve 2% 17% 7%\\nNet equity derivatives  (2,402) Option pricing Forward equity price(h) 74% 148% 100%\\nEquity volatility 3% 145% 28%\\nEquity correlation 15% 100% 57%\\nEquity-FX correlation (88)% 65% (30)%\\nEquity-IR correlation (19)% 20% 12%\\nNet commodity derivatives  (279) Option pricing Oil commodity forward $84 / BBL $270 / BBL $177 / BBL\\nNatural gas commodity forward $2 / MMBTU $6 / MMBTU $4 / MMBTU\\nCommodity volatility 17% 20% 18%\\nCommodity correlation (35)% 98% 31%\\nMSRs  8,522 Discounted cash flows Refer to Note 15\\nLong-term debt, short-term borrowings, and \\ndeposits(e)  30,078 Option pricing Interest rate volatility 25bps 420bps 117bps\\nBermudan switch value 0% 54% 19%\\nInterest rate correlation (82)% 90% 19%\\nIR-FX correlation (35)% 60% 5%\\nEquity correlation 15% 100% 57%\\nEquity-FX correlation (88)% 65% (30)%\\nEquity-IR correlation (19)% 20% 12%\\n 1,239 Discounted cash flows Credit correlation 35% 70% 51%\\nYield 5% 20% 12%\\nLoss severity 0% 100% 50%\\nOther level 3 assets and liabilities, net(f)  920 \\n(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated \\nbalance sheets.

Where relationships do exist \\nbetween two unobservable inputs, those relationships are \\ndiscussed below. Relationships may also exist between \\nobservable and unobservable inputs (for example, as \\nobservable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment \\nrates decline); such relationships have not been included in \\nthe discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual \\nrelationships described below, the inverse relationship would \\nalso generally apply. \\nThe following discussion also provides a description of \\nattributes of the underlying instruments and external market \\nfactors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of \\nthe Firm’s positions. \\nYield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to \\ndiscount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow \\ncalculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result \\nin a decrease in a fair value measurement. \\nCredit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional \\nannualized return over the market interest rate that a market \\nparticipant would demand for taking exposure to the credit \\nrisk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument \\nforms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow \\ncalculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would \\nresult in a decrease in a fair value measurement. \\nThe yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-\\nbacked security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the \\ninstrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of \\nthe coupon paid by the instrument (which may not \\ncorrespond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, \\nthe range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk \\ninherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk \\ninherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the \\nsubordination of the security being valued and the \\ncharacteristics of the underlying mortgages within the \\ncollateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV \\nratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the \\nproperty and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For \\ncorporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and \\nmunicipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads \\nreflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the \\nobligation. \\nPrepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of \\nthe voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a \\nprepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment \\nspeeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An \\nincrease in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a \\ndecrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a \\npremium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement \\nof assets valued at a discount to par. \\nPrepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to \\ncollateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the \\nunderlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the \\nobligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) \\nof interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically \\ncollateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a \\nhigher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower \\ncredit quality, all other factors being equal. \\nConditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a \\nmeasure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral \\nbalance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of \\ndefaults. While there is typically no direct relationship \\nbetween conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, \\ncollateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral \\nhas high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower \\nconditional default rates. An increase in conditional default \\nrates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss \\nseverity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the \\nconditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a \\ndecrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default \\nrates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a \\nsecuritization and the structure of the securitization itself. \\nBased on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market-\\nmaking portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically \\nat the lower end of the range presented. \\nLoss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the \\nrecovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized \\nlosses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular \\nloan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the \\noutstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is \\ngenerally accompanied by an increase in conditional default \\nrates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would \\nresult in a decrease in a fair value measurement. \\nThe loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed \\nsecurity depends on factors relating to the underlying \\nmortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender’s \\nlien on the property and other instrument-specific factors.\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 185'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 223, 'page_label': '186'}, page_content='Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship \\nbetween the movements of two variables. Correlation is a \\npricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is \\ndriven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are \\nrelated to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, \\nequity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature \\nof the underlying risks. When parameters are positively \\ncorrelated, an increase in one parameter will result in an \\nincrease in the other parameter. When parameters are \\nnegatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will \\nresult in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in \\ncorrelation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair \\nvalue measurement. Given a short correlation position, an \\nincrease in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in \\na decrease in a fair value measurement.\\nThe level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives \\nwith multiple underlying risks depends on a number of \\nfactors including the nature of those risks. For example, the \\ncorrelation between two credit risk exposures would be \\ndifferent than that between two interest rate risk exposures. \\nSimilarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the \\ncorrelation input, as the relationship between the underlying \\nrisks may be different over different time periods. \\nFurthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on \\nmarket conditions and could have a relatively wide range of \\nlevels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in \\nvolatile market conditions. \\nVolatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible \\nreturns for an instrument, parameter or market index given \\nhow much the particular instrument, parameter or index \\nchanges in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for \\noptions, including equity options, commodity options, and \\ninterest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of \\nthe underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long \\nposition in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, \\nwould generally result in an increase in a fair value \\nmeasurement. \\nThe level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular \\noption-based derivative depends on a number of factors, \\nincluding the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., \\nthe volatility of a particular equity security may be \\nsignificantly different from that of a particular commodity \\nindex), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price \\nof the option. \\nBermudan switch value – The switch value is the difference \\nbetween the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which can \\nbe exercised at multiple points in time, and its most \\nexpensive European swaption and reflects the additional \\nvalue that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder. \\nSwitch values are dependent on market conditions and can \\nvary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the \\ntenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price of the \\noption. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would \\ngenerally result in an increase in a fair value measurement.\\nInterest rate curve – The interest rate curve represents the \\nrelationship of interest rates over differing tenors. The \\ninterest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign \\nexchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing input \\nused in the discounting of any derivative cash flow.  \\nForward price – The forward price is the price at which the \\nbuyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward \\ncontract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is \\nsuch that the value of the contract is zero at inception. \\nThe forward price is used as an input in the valuation of \\ncertain derivatives and depends on a number of factors \\nincluding interest rates, the current price of the underlying \\nasset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be \\nincurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until \\nthe delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an \\nincrease or a decrease in a fair value measurement. \\nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value measurements \\nThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated \\nbalance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for \\nfinancial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of \\nthe fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, \\n2023, 2022 and 2021. When a determination is made to \\nclassify a financial instrument within level 3, the \\ndetermination is based on the significance of the \\nunobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. \\nHowever, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in \\naddition to the unobservable or level 3 components, \\nobservable components (that is, components that are actively \\nquoted and can be validated to external sources); \\naccordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include \\nchanges in fair value due in part to observable factors that \\nare part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-\\nmanages the observable components of level 3 financial \\ninstruments using securities and derivative positions that are \\nclassified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as \\nthese level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are \\nnot included below, the gains or losses in the following tables \\ndo not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management \\nactivities related to such level 3 instruments.\\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\\n186 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20

These market \\nparameters generally do not consider factors such as \\ncounterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit \\nquality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally \\nnecessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair \\nvalue to reflect these factors.\\nCVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant \\nbenchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty \\nnonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a \\nscenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit \\nexposure across all of the Firm’s existing positions with \\neach counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the \\nprobability of default and estimated recovery rate as a \\nresult of a counterparty credit event considering \\ncontractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit \\nexposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The \\nkey inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a \\ndefault event occurring for each counterparty, as derived \\nfrom observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated \\nrecovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider \\nthe differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor \\nrelative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally \\nreflect senior unsecured creditor risk.\\nFVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of \\nfunding and is recognized where there is evidence that a \\nmarket participant in the principal market would \\nincorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s \\nFVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including \\npartially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”) \\nderivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected \\nfunding requirements arising from the Firm’s positions with \\neach counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the \\nestimated market funding cost in the principal market \\nwhich, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit \\nrisk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is \\nestimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the \\nrelevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying \\ncollateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a \\nseparate FVA is not necessary.\\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and \\nfunding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in \\nthe respective periods, excluding the effect of any \\nassociated hedging activities. The FVA presented below \\nincludes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the \\ninception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes \\nin the Firm’s own credit quality over time.\\nYear ended December 31, \\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\\nCredit and funding adjustments:\\nDerivatives CVA $ 221 $ 22 $ 362 \\nDerivatives FVA  114  42  47 \\nValuation adjustments on fair value option elected \\nliabilities\\nThe valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair value \\noption has been elected requires consideration of the Firm’s \\nown credit risk.

The conversion rate of Visa B \\nshares to Visa A shares was 1.5875 at December 31, 2023 and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related \\nto the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have \\non the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2023, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the \\ntransfer restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B shares will be. As a \\nresult of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A \\nshares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.\\nIn connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the purchasers of the \\nshares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate. Under the terms of the derivative \\ninstruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make \\nperiodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue \\nas long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value \\nusing a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of \\nthe litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in \\nother income. As of December 31, 2023, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 23 million Visa B shares that \\nthe Firm had previously sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.\\nOn January 24, 2024, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC announcing that Visa’s stockholders approved \\namendments to its Certificate of Incorporation that redenominate the Visa B shares to Visa Class B-1 common shares (“Visa \\nB-1 shares”) and authorize Visa to conduct one or more exchange offers (\"the Program\") which, if conducted, would have the \\neffect of releasing transfer restrictions on a portion of Visa\\'s B-1 shares through an exchange for Visa Class C common shares \\n(“Visa C shares”). The Program would entitle the Firm to exchange its Visa B-1 shares, for Visa Class B-2 common shares (”Visa \\nB-2 shares”) and Visa C shares, through an initial exchange offer if and when conducted by Visa. The Visa B-2 shares would \\ncontinue to be subject to the transfer restrictions associated with the Visa B shares. The Firm is then entitled to sell the Visa C \\nshares received after a brief lock-up period expires, and Visa is also authorized to extend offers for potential future exchanges, \\neach enabling the release of additional Visa B shares if certain conditions are met. The timing and likelihood of any initial or \\nfuture exchange offer is dependent upon actions taken by Visa and other factors that may be outside of the Firm’s control.\\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\\n194 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 232, 'page_label': '195'}, page_content='Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial \\ninstruments that are not carried on the Consolidated \\nbalance sheets at fair value\\n \\nU.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of \\ncertain financial instruments, which are included in the \\nfollowing table.

JPMorgan Chase makes \\nmarkets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives \\nto hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly \\nall of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-\\nmaking or risk management purposes. \\nMarket-making derivatives \\nThe majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for \\nmarket-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate \\nor modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and \\ncommodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from \\nits exposure to these derivatives by entering into other \\nderivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other \\nfinancial instruments that partially or fully offset the \\nexposure from client derivatives. \\nRisk management derivatives \\nThe Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures \\nusing derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge \\naccounting relationships and other derivatives that are used \\nto manage risks associated with specified assets and \\nliabilities. \\nThe Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage \\nthe risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate \\nassets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market \\nvalue as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income \\nand expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-\\nrate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, \\nand as a result of the repayment and subsequent \\norigination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at \\ncurrent market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative \\ninstruments related to these assets and liabilities are \\nexpected to substantially offset this variability. \\nForeign currency derivatives are used to manage the \\nforeign exchange risk associated with certain foreign \\ncurrency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and \\nliabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm’s \\nnet investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches \\nwhose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a \\nresult of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar–\\nequivalent values of the foreign currency–denominated \\nassets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses \\nincrease or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative \\ninstruments related to these foreign currency–denominated \\nassets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected \\nto substantially offset this variability. \\nCommodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk \\nof certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these \\nderivative instruments are expected to substantially offset \\nthe depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. \\nCredit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty \\ncredit risk associated with loans and lending-related \\ncommitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser \\nwhen the entity referenced in the contract experiences a \\ncredit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an \\nobligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of \\nCDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages 214–\\n216 of this Note for a further discussion of credit \\nderivatives. \\nRefer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses \\ntable on page 214 and the hedge accounting gains and \\nlosses tables on pages 211–213 of this Note for more \\ninformation about risk management derivatives. \\nDerivative counterparties and settlement types \\nThe Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated \\nand settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The \\nFirm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as \\nfutures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts \\nwith CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized \\ncontracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, \\nwhich is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the \\ntransactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a \\nbilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing. \\nDerivative clearing services \\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the \\nFirm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and \\nclearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ \\nderivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial \\nStatements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the \\nFirm’s clearing services. \\nAccounting for derivatives \\nAll free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its \\nown account are required to be recorded on the \\nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value. \\nAs permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative \\nassets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral \\nreceivables and payables, when a legally enforceable \\nmaster netting agreement exists between the Firm and the \\nderivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further \\ndiscussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The \\naccounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on \\nwhether or not the transaction has been designated and \\nqualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not \\ndesignated as hedges are reported and measured at fair \\nvalue through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages \\n207–214 of this Note provide additional information on the \\namount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, \\ngains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further \\ndiscussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes. \\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 203'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 241, 'page_label': '204'}, page_content='Derivatives designated as hedges \\nThe Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives \\nexecuted for risk management purposes – generally interest \\nrate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. \\nHowever, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge \\naccounting to all of the derivatives associated with the \\nFirm’s risk management activities. For example, the Firm \\ndoes not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to \\nmanage the credit risk of loans and lending-related \\ncommitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such \\ncontracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does \\nnot apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign \\nexchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk \\nmanagement purposes.  \\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly \\neffective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure \\nbeing hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated \\nas a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy \\nmust be documented. Hedge documentation must identify \\nthe derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or \\nforecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and \\nhow the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed \\nprospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, \\nthe Firm uses statistical methods such as regression \\nanalysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value \\ncomparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative \\nto the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged \\nitem, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the \\nevaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to \\nwhich a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to \\nbe, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or \\ncash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and \\ndocumented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a \\nderivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated \\nexposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. \\nThere are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair \\nvalue hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. \\nJPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge \\nfixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain \\ncommodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, \\nthe changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the \\nvalue of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are \\nrecognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the \\nassessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and \\nrecognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the \\nhedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to \\nthe hedged item continues to be reported as part of the \\nbasis of the hedged item and, for interest-bearing financial \\ninstruments, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. \\nDerivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized \\nconsistent with the classification of the hedged item – \\nprimarily net interest income and principal transactions \\nrevenue. \\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the new \\nportfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which \\nexpanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of fixed-rate \\nassets to allow more types of assets to be included in the \\nportfolio, and to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. \\nThe Firm employs the Portfolio Layer Method to manage \\nthe interest rate risk of portfolios of fixed-rate assets. \\nThroughout the life of the open hedge, basis adjustments \\nare maintained at the portfolio level and are only allocated \\nto individual assets under certain circumstances. These \\ninclude instances where the portfolio amount falls below \\nthe hedged layer amounts, or in cases of voluntary de-\\ndesignation.\\nJPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge \\nthe exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from \\nfloating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency–\\ndenominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow \\nhedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are \\nrecorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged \\nitem affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting \\nearnings are recognized consistent with the classification of \\nthe hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net \\ninterest income and compensation expense. If the hedge \\nrelationship is terminated, then the change in value of the \\nderivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when \\nthe cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge \\nrelationships that are discontinued because a forecasted \\ntransaction is expected to not occur according to the \\noriginal hedge forecast, any related derivative values \\nrecorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. \\nJPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the \\nvalue of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. \\nsubsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are \\nnot the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, \\nchanges in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes \\nin spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as \\ntranslation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the \\nassessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in \\nearnings. \\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\\n204 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 242, 'page_label': '205'}, page_content='The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure \\ncategory.\\nType of Derivative Use of Derivative Designation and disclosure\\nAffected \\nsegment or unit\\nPage \\nreference\\nManage specifically identified risk exposures in qualifying hedge accounting relationships:\\n• Interest rate Hedge fixed rate assets and liabilities Fair value hedge Corporate 211-212\\n• Interest rate Hedge floating-rate assets and liabilities Cash flow hedge Corporate 213\\n• Foreign exchange Hedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities Fair value hedge Corporate 211-212\\n• Foreign exchange Hedge foreign currency-denominated forecasted revenue and \\nexpense\\nCash flow hedge Corporate 213\\n• Foreign exchange Hedge the value of the Firm’s investments in non-U.S. dollar \\nfunctional currency entities\\nNet investment hedge Corporate 213\\n• Commodity Hedge commodity inventory Fair value hedge CIB, AWM 211-212\\nManage specifically identified risk exposures not designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships:\\n• Interest rate Manage the risk associated with mortgage commitments, warehouse \\nloans and MSRs\\nSpecified risk management CCB 214\\n• Credit Manage the credit risk associated with wholesale lending exposures Specified risk management CIB, AWM 214\\n• Interest rate and \\nforeign exchange\\nManage the risk associated with certain other specified assets and \\nliabilities\\nSpecified risk management Corporate, CIB 214\\nMarket-making derivatives and other activities:\\n• Various Market-making and related risk management Market-making and other CIB 214\\n• Various Other derivatives Market-making and other CIB, AWM, \\nCorporate\\n214\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 205'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 243, 'page_label': '206'}, page_content='Notional amount of derivative contracts \\nThe following table summarizes the notional amount of \\nfree-standing derivative contracts outstanding as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\\nNotional amounts(b)\\nDecember 31, (in billions) 2023 2022\\nInterest rate contracts\\nSwaps $ 23,251 $ 24,491 \\nFutures and forwards  2,690  2,636 \\nWritten options  3,370  3,047 \\nPurchased options  3,362  2,992 \\nTotal interest rate contracts  32,673  33,166 \\nCredit derivatives(a)  1,045  1,132 \\nForeign exchange contracts\\nCross-currency swaps  4,721  4,196 \\nSpot, futures and forwards  6,957  7,017 \\nWritten options  830  775 \\nPurchased options  798  759 \\nTotal foreign exchange contracts  13,306  12,747 \\nEquity contracts\\nSwaps  639  618 \\nFutures and forwards  157  110 \\nWritten options  778  636 \\nPurchased options  698  580 \\nTotal equity contracts  2,272  1,944 \\nCommodity contracts\\nSwaps  115  136 \\nSpot, futures and forwards  157  136 \\nWritten options  130  117 \\nPurchased options  115  98 \\nTotal commodity contracts  517  487 \\nTotal derivative notional amounts $ 49,813 $ 49,476 \\n(a) Refer to the Credit derivatives discussion on pages 214–216 for more \\ninformation on volumes and types of credit derivative contracts.\\n(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short third-party notional \\nderivative contracts.\\nWhile the notional amounts disclosed above give an \\nindication of the volume of\\n the Firm’s derivatives activity, \\nthe notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm’s \\nview, the possible losses that could arise from such \\ntransactions.

Credit derivatives \\nexpose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of \\nthe protection seller, as the protection seller is required to \\nmake payments under the contract when the reference \\nentity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a \\nfailure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of \\ncredit protection receives a premium for providing \\nprotection but has the risk that the underlying instrument \\nreferenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event.\\n \\nThe Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the \\ncredit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two \\nprimary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker,\\n \\nthe Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives \\nby purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly \\non corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of \\ncustomers. Second, as an end-user,\\n the Firm uses credit \\nderivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending \\nexposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its \\nwholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives \\ncounterparty exposures in its\\n wholesale businesses, and to \\nmanage the credit risk arising from certain financial \\ninstruments in\\n the Firm’s market-making businesses. \\nFollowing is a summary of various types of credit \\nderivatives.\\n \\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\\n214 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\\nDerivatives gains/(losses) \\nrecorded in income\\nDerivatives gains/(losses) \\nrecorded in income'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 252, 'page_label': '215'}, page_content='Credit default swaps \\nCredit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single \\nreference entity (“single-name”), broad-based index or \\nportfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both \\nsingle- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name \\nCDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared \\nderivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage \\nthe default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS \\ncontracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with \\nthe broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like \\nthe S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists \\nof a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New \\nseries of CDS indices are periodically established with a new \\nunderlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes \\nin the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the \\nindex experiences a credit event, then the reference entity \\nthat defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be \\nreferenced against specific portfolios of reference names or \\nagainst customized exposure levels: for example, to provide \\nprotection against the first $1 million of realized credit \\nlosses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. Such \\nstructures are commonly known as tranche CDS. \\nFor both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS \\ncontracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the \\nterms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract \\nhas recourse to the reference entity. The protection \\npurchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the \\ndifference between the face value of the CDS contract and \\nthe fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of \\nthe credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery \\nvalue. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the \\ndebt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order \\nto receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a \\ncredit event occurs. \\nCredit-related notes \\nA credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk \\ncomponent where the issuer of the credit-related note \\npurchases from the note investor credit protection on a \\nreference entity or an index. Under the contract, the \\ninvestor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the \\ninception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer makes \\nperiodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk \\nof the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor \\nthe par value of the note at maturity unless the reference \\nentity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference \\nindex) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event \\noccurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of \\nthe note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the \\ndifference between the par value of the note and the fair \\nvalue of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of \\nsettlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has \\nrecourse to the defaulting reference entity.\\nThe following tables present a summary of the notional \\namounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the \\nFirm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2023 and \\n2022. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection \\nwould typically pay out a percentage of the full notional \\namount of net protection sold, as the amount actually \\nrequired to be paid on the contracts takes into account the \\nrecovery value of the reference obligation at the time of \\nsettlement.

Under the \\nterms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2023, 54 million \\nshares of common stock were available for issuance \\nthrough May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under \\nwhich the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive \\nawards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm \\nplans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are \\nreferred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans \\nconstitute the Firm’s share-based incentive plans. \\nRSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their \\ngrant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a \\nrate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and \\nare converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting \\ndate. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility \\nprovisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon \\nvoluntary termination based on age and/or service-related \\nrequirements, subject to post-employment and other \\nrestrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until \\nvested and contain clawback provisions that may result in \\ncancellation under certain specified circumstances. \\nPredominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash \\npayments equivalent to any dividends paid on the \\nunderlying common stock during the period the RSUs are \\noutstanding. \\nPerformance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, \\nand approved by the Firm’s Board of Directors, to members \\nof the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable \\ncompensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firm’s \\nachievement of specified performance criteria over a three-\\nyear period. The number of awards that vest can range \\nfrom zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, \\ndividends that accrue during the vesting period are \\nreinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the \\nrelated dividend equivalent share units are converted into \\nshares of common stock after vesting.\\nOnce the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have \\nvested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after \\napplicable tax withholding, must be retained for an \\nadditional holding period, for a total combined vesting and \\nholding period of approximately five to eight years from the \\ngrant date depending on regulations in certain countries. \\nUnder the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”)  \\nwere generally granted with an exercise price equal to the \\nfair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock on the grant \\ndate. SARs generally expire ten years after the grant date. \\nIn 2021, the Firm awarded its Chairman and CEO and its \\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer 1.5 million and \\n750,000 SARs, respectively. There were no grants of SARs \\nin 2023 or 2022. \\nThe Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for \\neach tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as \\nif it were a separate award with its own vesting date. \\nGenerally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense \\nis recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date \\nuntil the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided \\nthat the employees will not become full-career eligible \\nduring the vesting period. For awards with full-career \\neligibility provisions and awards granted with no future \\nsubstantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the \\nestimated value of awards expected to be awarded to \\nemployees as of the grant date without giving consideration \\nto the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each \\ntranche granted to employees who will become full-career \\neligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is \\nrecognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until \\nthe earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or \\nthe vesting date of the respective tranche. \\nThe Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of \\nemployee share-based incentive awards is to issue either \\nnew shares of common stock or treasury shares. During \\n2023, 2022 and 2021, the Firm settled all of its employee \\nshare-based awards by issuing treasury shares. \\nRefer to Note 23 for further information on the \\nclassification of share-based awards for purposes of \\ncalculating earnings per share.\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 225'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 263, 'page_label': '226'}, page_content='RSUs, PSUs and SARs activity \\nGenerally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by the stock \\nprice at the grant date, and for SARs, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

In these \\ncircumstances the impairment loss is recognized in \\ninvestment securities gains/(losses) in the Consolidated \\nStatements of Income and is equal to the full difference \\nbetween the amortized cost (net of allowance if applicable) \\nand the fair value of the security. \\nFor impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent \\nand ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to \\ndetermine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a \\ncredit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for \\ncredit losses through the provision for credit losses in the \\nConsolidated Statements of Income, limited by the amount \\nof impairment. Any impairment on debt securities that the \\nFirm has the intent and ability to hold not due to credit \\nlosses is recorded in OCI. \\nFactors considered in evaluating credit losses include \\nadverse conditions specifically related to the industry, \\ngeographic area or financial condition of the issuer or \\nunderlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of \\nthe security. \\nWhen assessing securities issued in a securitization for \\ncredit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering \\nrelevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level \\ndata, and structural features of the securitization, such as \\nsubordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other \\nforms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses \\nprojected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) \\nagainst the level of credit enhancement in the securitization \\nstructure to determine whether these features are sufficient \\nto absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists. \\nFor beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated \\nbelow “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually \\nprepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm \\nwould not recover substantially all of its recorded \\ninvestment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses \\nwhen there is an adverse change in expected cash flows. \\nHTM securities – credit risk\\nAllowance for credit losses\\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM securities \\nrepresents expected credit losses over the remaining \\nexpected life of the securities.\\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. \\nstates and municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed \\nsecurities is calculated by applying statistical credit loss \\nfactors (estimated PD and LGD) to the amortized cost. The \\ncredit loss factors are derived using a weighted average of \\nfive internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic \\nscenarios, followed by a single year straight-line \\ninterpolation to revert to long run historical information for \\nperiods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for \\nfurther information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic \\nforecast. \\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan \\nobligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities\\nis calculated as the difference between the amortized cost \\nand the present value of the cash flows expected to be \\ncollected, discounted at the security’s effective interest \\nrate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on \\nexpectations of underlying collateral performance derived \\nusing the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the \\nsingle year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering \\nthe structural features of the security. \\nThe application of different inputs and assumptions into the \\ncalculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to \\nsignificant management judgment, and emphasizing one \\ninput or assumption over another, or considering other \\ninputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the \\nallowance for credit losses on HTM securities. \\nCredit quality indicator\\nThe primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the \\nrisk rating assigned to each security.

Where appropriate under applicable accounting \\nguidance, securities financing agreements with the same \\ncounterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 \\nfor further discussion of the offsetting of assets and \\nliabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with \\nsecurities financing agreements are recorded over the life \\nof the agreement in interest income and interest expense \\non the Consolidated statements of income. \\nThe Firm has elected the fair value option for certain \\nsecurities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further \\ninformation regarding the fair value option. The securities \\nfinancing agreements for which the fair value option has \\nbeen elected are reported within securities purchased \\nunder resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under \\nrepurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the \\nConsolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements \\ncarried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are \\nrecorded within interest income and interest expense, with \\nchanges in fair value reported in principal transactions \\nrevenue. However, for financial instruments containing \\nembedded derivatives that would be separately accounted \\nfor in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid \\ninstruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest \\nelements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. \\nSecurities financing agreements not elected under the fair \\nvalue option are measured at amortized cost.

In \\nrepurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk \\nexposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying \\nsecurities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash \\nprincipal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. \\nAdditionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting \\nagreements and other similar arrangements with its \\ncounterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the \\nunderlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged \\nin the event of a counterparty default.

The Firm accounts for loans based on \\nthe following categories:\\n• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., \\n“retained”)\\n• Loans held-for-sale\\n• Loans at fair value\\nThe following provides a detailed accounting discussion of \\nthe Firm’s loans by category:\\nLoans held-for-investment\\nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment, \\nincluding PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting \\nthe principal amount outstanding, net of the following: \\nunamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or \\ndiscounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign \\nexchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance \\ncharges and fees.\\nInterest income\\nInterest income on performing loans held-for-investment is \\naccrued and recognized as interest income at the \\ncontractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or \\npremiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are \\nrecognized in interest income over the contractual life of \\nthe loan as an adjustment of yield.\\nThe Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including \\naccrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in \\naccrued interest and accounts receivables on the \\nConsolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued \\ninterest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, \\nwith the related allowance recorded in the allowance for \\ncredit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on \\naccrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the \\nprovision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized \\nby reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm \\ngenerally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses \\non accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to \\nwrite them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing \\ninterest income. \\nNonaccrual loans \\nNonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest \\nhas been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans \\nand certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government \\nagencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered \\nnonperforming when full payment of principal and interest \\nis not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when \\nprincipal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 \\ndays or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in \\nthe process of collection. A loan is determined to be past \\ndue when the minimum payment is not received from the \\nborrower by the contractually specified due date or for \\ncertain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a \\nmonthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. \\nFinally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained \\non nonaccrual status. \\nOn the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all \\ninterest accrued but not collected is reversed against \\ninterest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred \\namounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans \\nmay be recognized as cash interest payments are received \\n(i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is \\ndeemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt \\nregarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan \\nbalance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the \\ncarrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For \\nconsumer loans, application of this policy typically results in \\nthe Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual \\nconsumer loans on a cash basis.\\nA loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is \\nreasonably assured and there has been demonstrated \\nperformance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, \\nthe terms of the restructured loan. \\nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are \\ngenerally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; \\naccordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans \\ncontinue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in \\nfull. \\nAllowance for loan losses \\nThe allowance for loan losses represents the estimated \\nexpected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan \\nportfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the \\nbalance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized \\ncost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for \\nloan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on \\nthe Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to \\nNote 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting \\npolicies for the allowance for loan losses. \\nCharge-offs \\nConsumer loans are generally charged off or charged down \\nto the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable \\nvalue of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less \\nestimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for \\nloan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency \\nin accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. \\nResidential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans \\nand scored business banking loans are generally charged \\noff no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and \\nclosed-end consumer loans, including modified credit card \\naccounts placed on a fixed payment plan, are charged off \\nno later than 120 days past due. \\nCertain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to \\ntheir net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off \\nstandards in the following circumstances: \\n• Loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial \\ndifficulty that are determined to be collateral-\\ndependent. \\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 235'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 273, 'page_label': '236'}, page_content='• Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that \\nsuggests a loss is either known or highly certain are \\nsubject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., \\nresidential real estate and auto loans are charged off or \\ncharged down within 60 days of receiving notification of \\na bankruptcy filing). \\n• Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile. \\nOther than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm \\ntypically does not recognize charge-offs on the government-\\nguaranteed portion of loans. \\nWholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain \\nthat a loss has been realized. The determination of whether \\nto recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including \\nthe prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, \\nexpectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and \\nvaluation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. \\nWhen a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized \\ncost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying \\ncollateral, the determination of the fair value of the \\ncollateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, \\nreal estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of \\nliquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market \\nprices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other \\nfinancial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally \\nestimated using a discounted cash flow model. \\nFor residential real estate loans, collateral values are based \\nupon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely \\nthat a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the \\nFirm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an \\nautomated valuation model of the home based on an \\nexterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then \\nupdated at least every 12 months, or more frequently \\ndepending on various market factors. As soon as practicable \\nafter the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt \\n(e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm \\ngenerally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that \\nincludes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). \\nExterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted \\nbased upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation \\nvalues as compared with the estimated values provided by \\nexterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-\\nspecific factors. \\nFor commercial real estate loans, collateral values are \\ngenerally based on appraisals from internal and external \\nvaluation sources. Collateral values are typically updated \\nevery six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new \\nappraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in \\naccordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers \\nboth borrower- and market-specific factors, which may \\nresult in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price \\nopinions at more frequent intervals.\\nLoans held-for-sale \\nLoans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair \\nvalue, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest \\nrevenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on \\na portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is \\nperformed on an individual loan basis. \\nInterest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and \\nrecognized based on the contractual rate of interest. \\nLoan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts \\nor premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the \\nrelated loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and \\ndiscounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the \\nloan and therefore are included in the periodic \\ndetermination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments \\nand/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale. \\nBecause these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or \\nfair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-\\noff policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans \\nheld-for-sale are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual policies. \\nLoans at fair value \\nLoans for which the fair value option has been elected are \\nmeasured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded \\nin noninterest revenue. \\nInterest income on these loans is accrued and recognized \\nbased on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair \\nvalue are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan \\norigination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest \\nrevenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the \\nassociated expense category as incurred. \\nBecause these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s \\nallowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not \\napply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are \\nsubject to the Firm’s nonaccrual policies. \\nRefer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s \\nelections of fair value accounting under the fair value \\noption.

These loans are subsequently assessed for \\nimpairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. \\nRefer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the \\nmethodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for \\nloan losses. \\nLoan modifications \\nThe Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with \\nits loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, \\nJPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a \\nborrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to \\nminimize the Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or \\nrepossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize \\npayments received by the Firm from the borrower. The \\nconcessions granted vary by program and by borrower-\\nspecific characteristics, and may include interest rate \\nreductions, term extensions, other-than-insignificant \\npayment delays or principal forgiveness. Effective January \\n1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit \\nLosses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage \\nDisclosure accounting guidance, which changed the \\naccounting for loan modifications from TDRs to FDMs. Refer \\nto Note 1 for further information. \\nLoans, except for credit card loans, reported as FDMs are \\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many \\ncases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to \\nmodification. These loans may be returned to performing \\nstatus (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following \\ncriteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the \\nmodified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six \\npayments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that \\nrepayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based \\non, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of \\nfuture earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other \\ncurrent market considerations. In certain limited and well-\\ndefined circumstances in which the loan is current at the \\nmodification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual \\nstatus at the time of modification. \\nThe allowance for credit losses associated with FDMs is \\nmeasured using the Firm’s established allowance \\nmethodology, which considers the expected re-default rates \\nfor the modified loans. Refer to Note 13 for further \\ndiscussion. \\nFor periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications \\nof loans where the Firm granted concessions to a borrower \\nexperiencing financial difficulty were accounted for and \\nreported as TDRs. The concessions granted varied by \\nprogram and by borrower-specific characteristics, and \\nincluded interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment \\ndelays, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or \\nother assets in lieu of payments. Loans with short-term and \\nother insignificant modifications that were not considered \\nconcessions were not TDRs.\\nLoans modified in TDRs were generally measured for \\nimpairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific \\nallowance methodology, which considers the expected \\nredefault rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a \\nTDR generally remained subject to the asset-specific \\ncomponent of the allowance throughout its remaining life, \\nregardless of whether the loan was performing and had \\nbeen returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for \\nfurther discussion.\\nForeclosed property \\nThe Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan \\nrestructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property \\nacquired may include real property (e.g., residential real \\nestate, land, and buildings) and other commercial and \\npersonal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and \\nships). \\nThe Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving \\nassets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or \\nphysical possession). For loans collateralized by real \\nproperty, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received \\nat foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of \\nforeclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed \\nassets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated \\nbalance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less \\nestimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the \\nacquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to \\nthe lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to \\nfair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. \\nOperating expense, such as real estate taxes and \\nmaintenance, are charged to other expense. \\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 237'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 275, 'page_label': '238'}, page_content=\"Loan portfolio \\nThe Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine \\nthe allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale.

Loans that are more than 30 days past \\ndue provide an early warning of borrowers who may be \\nexperiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be \\nunable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues \\nto age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely \\nto be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential \\nreal estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than \\n150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will \\nultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation \\ntransaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit \\nquality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the \\nclass of loan, as follows: \\n• For residential real estate loans, the current estimated \\nLTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior \\nlien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in \\nthe event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV \\nratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued \\nwillingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV \\nloans tends to be greater than that for loans where the \\nborrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic \\ndistribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as \\nto the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as \\nthe regional economy, home price changes and specific \\nevents such as natural disasters, will affect credit \\nquality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO \\nscore is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain \\nloans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s \\ncredit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a \\nlow FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of \\nhigher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO \\nscore. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV \\nratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default \\nthan a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio \\nand a high FICO score.\\n• For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic \\ndistribution is an indicator of the credit performance of \\nthe portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, \\ngeographic distribution provides insights into the \\nportfolio performance based on regional economic \\nactivity and events.\\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\\n240 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 278, 'page_label': '241'}, page_content='Residential real estate \\nDelinquency is the primary credit quality indicator for retained residential real estate loans.

Risk ratings \\nare used to identify the credit quality of loans and \\ndifferentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans \\nconsider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a \\nloan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan \\nthat would be realized upon the default of the borrower and \\ntakes into consideration collateral and structural support \\nfor each credit facility. \\nManagement considers several factors to determine an \\nappropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt \\ncapacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s \\nearnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level \\nand nature of contingencies, management strength, and the \\nindustry and geography in which the obligor operates. The \\nFirm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the \\nqualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet \\nfinancial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the \\neconomic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, \\nhowever the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) \\nmay differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and \\nassumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings \\nwith qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or \\nhigher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower \\nPD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.  \\nNoninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as \\nnoncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is \\nfurther subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, \\nrepresenting management’s assessment of the collectibility \\nof principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD \\nthan noncriticized loans. The Firm’s definition of criticized \\naligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of \\ncriticized exposures, which consist of special mention, \\nsubstandard and doubtful categories.

The allowance for credit \\nlosses generally comprises:\\n• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s \\nretained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), \\n• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is \\npresented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts \\npayable and other liabilities, and \\n• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, \\nwhich is reflected in investment securities on the \\nConsolidated balance sheets.\\nThe income statement effect of all changes in the allowance \\nfor credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit \\nlosses. \\nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit \\nlosses is complex and requires significant judgment by \\nmanagement about the effect of matters that are inherently \\nuncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses \\nis reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the \\nFirm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, \\nconsidering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and \\nother factors then prevailing, may result in significant \\nchanges in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. \\nThe Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for loan \\nlosses and its allowance for lending-related commitments \\nare described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 \\nfor a description of the policies used to determine the \\nallowance for credit losses on investment securities. \\nMethodology for allowances for loan losses and lending-\\nrelated commitments\\nThe allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-\\nrelated commitments represents expected credit losses \\nover the remaining expected life of retained loans and \\nlending-related commitments that are not unconditionally \\ncancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for \\nfuture draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related \\ncommitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to \\naccrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the \\nFirm’s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does \\nnot record an allowance on other accrued interest \\nreceivables, due to its policy to write these receivables off \\nno later than 90 days past due by reversing interest \\nincome. \\nThe expected life of each instrument is determined by \\nconsidering its contractual term, expected prepayments, \\ncancellation features, and certain extension and call \\noptions. The expected life of funded credit card loans is \\ngenerally estimated by considering expected future \\npayments on the credit card account, and determining how \\nmuch of those amounts should be allocated to repayments \\nof the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) \\nversus other account activity. This allocation is made using \\nan approach that incorporates the payment application \\nrequirements of the Credit Card Accountability \\nResponsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying \\ndown the highest interest rate balances first. \\nThe estimate of expected credit losses includes expected \\nrecoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to \\nbe charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative \\nallowance. \\nCollective and Individual Assessments\\nWhen calculating the allowance for loan losses and the \\nallowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm \\nassesses whether exposures share similar risk \\ncharacteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm \\nestimates expected credit losses collectively, considering \\nthe risk associated with a particular pool and the probability \\nthat the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or \\ndefault. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to \\nsignificant management judgment. Emphasizing one \\ncharacteristic over another or considering additional \\ncharacteristics could affect the allowance. \\n• Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio \\ninclude product type, delinquency status, current FICO \\nscores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized \\nloans, current LTV ratios.  \\n• Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio \\ninclude risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and \\ntype of collateral, LOB, geography, industry, credit \\nenhancement, product type, facility purpose, and \\npayment terms. \\nThe majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk \\ncharacteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result \\nare collectively assessed for impairment (“portfolio-based \\ncomponent”). The portfolio-based component covers \\nconsumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain \\nlending-related commitments. \\nIf an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other \\nexposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit \\nlosses on an individual basis, considering expected \\nrepayment and conditions impacting that individual \\nexposure (“asset-specific component”). The asset-specific \\ncomponent covers collateral-dependent loans and risk-\\nrated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. \\nPortfolio-based component\\nThe portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative \\ncalculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower \\nchanging delinquency status or moving from one risk rating \\nto another. The quantitative calculation covers expected \\ncredit losses over an instrument’s expected life and is \\nestimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm’s \\nestimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors \\nincorporate the probability of borrower default as well as \\nloss severity in the event of default. They are derived using \\na weighted average of five internally developed \\nmacroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast \\nperiod, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation \\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 255\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 293, 'page_label': '256'}, page_content='to revert to long run historical information for periods \\nbeyond the eight-quarter forecast period.

The scenarios take into consideration the \\nFirm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from \\nsubject matter experts across the Firm, and market \\nconsensus and involve a governed process that incorporates \\nfeedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate \\nFinance and Risk Management.\\nThe quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into \\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk \\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that are \\nnot yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are \\naccomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss \\nexperience, including during stressed periods, for each \\nmajor product or model.

In certain instances, the interrelationships \\nbetween these factors create further uncertainties.\\nThe application of different inputs into the quantitative \\ncalculation, and the assumptions used by management to \\nadjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant \\nmanagement judgment, and emphasizing one input or \\nassumption over another, or considering other inputs or \\nassumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for \\nloan losses and the allowance for lending-related \\ncommitments.\\nAsset-specific component \\nTo determine the asset-specific component of the \\nallowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those \\nloans for which foreclosure is probable) and nonaccrual \\nrisk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are \\ngenerally evaluated individually.\\nOn January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial \\nInstruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings \\naccounting guidance as described in Note 1.\\nThe adoption of this guidance eliminated the requirement \\nto measure the allowance for TDRs using a discounted cash \\nflow (DCF) methodology and allowed the option of a non-\\nDCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to \\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty. If a DCF \\nmethodology is still applied for these modified loans, the \\ndiscount rate must be the post-modification effective \\ninterest rate, instead of the pre-modification effective \\ninterest rate. \\nThe Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance \\napproach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance \\napproach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all \\nportfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual \\nrisk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance \\napproach will continue to apply. The adoption did not \\nimpact the collateral-dependent allowance approach or \\nscope.\\nThis guidance was adopted under the modified \\nretrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to \\nthe allowance for credit losses of $587 million and an \\nincrease to retained earnings of $446 million, after-tax \\npredominantly driven by residential real estate and credit \\ncard.\\nFor collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral \\nless estimated costs to sell, as applicable, is used to \\ndetermine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to \\nreduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of \\ncollateral) or the amount of negative allowance that should \\nbe recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs \\nassociated with improvements in the fair value of the \\ncollateral).\\nFor non-collateral dependent loans, the Firm generally \\nmeasures the asset-specific allowance as the difference \\nbetween the amortized cost of the loan and the present \\nvalue of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted \\nat the loan’s effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in \\nimpairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to \\nthe allowance for loan losses. The asset-specific component \\nof the allowance for non-collateral dependent loans \\nincorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s \\nexpected cash flows including changes in interest rates, \\nprincipal forgiveness, and other concessions, as well as  \\nmanagement’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to \\nrepay under the modified terms. \\nEstimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is \\nhighly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon \\nestimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, the \\namounts and timing of interest or principal payments \\n(including any expected prepayments) or other factors that \\nare reflective of current and expected market conditions. \\nThese estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as \\nthe duration of current overall economic conditions, \\nindustry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the \\nexpected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in \\ncertain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these \\nestimates and assumptions require significant management \\njudgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective. \\nOther financial assets\\nIn addition to loans and investment securities, the Firm \\nholds other financial assets that are measured at amortized \\ncost on the Consolidated balance sheets, including credit \\nexposures arising from lending activities subject to \\ncollateral maintenance requirements. Management \\nestimates the allowance for other financial assets using \\nvarious techniques considering historical losses and current \\neconomic conditions. \\nCredit risk arising from lending activities subject to \\ncollateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated \\nby factors such as the short-term nature of the activity, the \\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\\n256 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 294, 'page_label': '257'}, page_content='fair value of collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, \\nand the borrower’s obligation to provide additional margin \\nwhen the fair value of the collateral declines.

As asset manager of the \\nfunds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is competitively \\npriced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable \\ninterests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.\\n• Commercial Banking: CB \\nprovides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain \\nthird-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and \\ndoes not consolidate these entities. CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally \\nlimited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other third-\\nparty transaction.\\n \\n• Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally \\nsubject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including \\nVIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of \\nVIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant \\nactivities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities.

For securitizations of loans serviced by \\nCCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant \\nactivities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions \\nrelated to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also \\nretain an interest upon securitization.\\nIn addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading \\nactivities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored \\nsecuritization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior \\nand/or subordinated interests (including residual interests \\nand amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk \\nretention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at \\nthe time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the \\nsecondary market in the normal course of business. In \\ncertain instances, as a result of the positions retained or \\nreacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when \\nconsidered together with the servicing arrangements \\nentered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary \\nbeneficiary of certain securitization trusts. \\nThe Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage \\nsecuritizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) \\nwhen it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the \\npower to direct the most significant activities of the trust) \\nor does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could \\npotentially be significant to the trust.\\nCommercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations\\nCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, \\nand engages in underwriting and trading activities involving \\nthe securities issued by securitization trusts.

These transfers occur in \\nconnection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency \\nsponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. \\nThe Firm’s consolidation analysis is largely dependent on \\nthe Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.\\nThe following table presents the principal amount of \\nsecurities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.\\nYear ended December 31, \\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\\nTransfers of securities to VIEs\\nU.S. GSEs and government \\nagencies $ 18,864 $ 16,128 $ 53,923 \\nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are \\nclient-driven transactions in which a specific client or group \\nof clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile.

The conduits fund their \\nfinancing facilities through the issuance of highly rated \\ncommercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the \\ncommercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. \\nIn most instances, the assets are structured with deal-\\nspecific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by \\nthe customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal-\\nspecific credit enhancements are generally structured to \\ncover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of \\nassets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization \\nprovided by the seller.

In a typical TOB \\ntransaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal \\nbond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing \\ntwo types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate \\ncertificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate \\nresidual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are typically \\npurchased by money market funds or other short-term \\ninvestors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the \\nTOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor \\nseeking to finance its municipal bond investment.\\n TOB \\ntransactions where the residual is held by a third-party \\ninvestor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and \\nnon-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the \\nResidual is retained by\\n the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are \\nsponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for \\nall non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide \\nvarious services to a TOB trust, including remarketing \\nagent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.\\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing \\nagent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent \\nis responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on \\nthe floaters, conducting the initial placement and \\nremarketing tendered floater\\ns.

If the fair value is in excess of the \\ncarrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is \\nconsidered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than \\nthe carrying value, then an impairment is recognized for the \\namount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value \\nexceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill \\nallocated to that reporting unit. \\nThe Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus \\ngoodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the \\ncarrying values of equity for the reporting units in the \\ngoodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is \\ndetermined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to \\nthe LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors \\nincluding capital levels of similarly rated peers and \\napplicable regulatory capital requirements. LOB’s allocated \\ncapital levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual \\nbudget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of \\nDirectors and Operating Committee. Allocated capital is \\nfurther reviewed at least annually and updated as needed.\\nThe primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value \\nof its reporting units is the income approach. This approach \\nprojects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the \\nperpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. \\nThese cash flows and terminal values, which are based on \\nthe reporting units’ annual budgets and forecasts are then \\ndiscounted using an appropriate discount rate. The discount \\nrate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of \\nthe cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined \\nconsidering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity \\n(estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as \\nadjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each \\nreporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or \\nuncertainty associated with the business or management’s \\nforecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness \\nof the discount rates used for each reporting unit, \\nmanagement compares the discount rate to the estimated \\ncost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar \\nbusinesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the \\nweighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various \\nreporting units) is compared with the Firm’s overall \\nestimated cost of equity for reasonableness. The valuations \\nderived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then \\ncompared with market-based trading and transaction \\nmultiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction \\ncomparables are used as general indicators to assess the \\noverall reasonableness of the estimated fair values, \\nalthough precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn \\ndue to the differences that naturally exist between the \\nFirm’s businesses and competitor institutions. \\nThe Firm also takes into consideration a comparison \\nbetween the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting \\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 269'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 307, 'page_label': '270'}, page_content='units and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In \\nevaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several \\nfactors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a \\nmarket transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of \\nexecution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do \\nnot exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term \\nmarket volatility and other factors that do not directly \\naffect the value of individual reporting units.\\nUnanticipated declines in business performance, increases \\nin credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as \\ndeterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse \\nregulatory or legislative changes or increases in the \\nestimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated \\nfair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the \\nfuture, which could result in a material impairment loss to \\nearnings in a future period related to some portion of the \\nassociated goodwill. \\nMortgage servicing rights\\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows \\nfor performing servicing activities for others. The fair value \\nconsiders estimated future servicing fees and ancillary \\nrevenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and \\ngenerally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are \\nreceived, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against \\ncontractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are \\neither purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale \\nor securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\\nAs permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account \\nfor its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a \\nsingle class of servicing assets based on the availability of \\nmarket inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR \\nasset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for \\nrisk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair \\nvalue of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) \\nmodel, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest \\nrate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment \\nmodel, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted \\nrates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, \\ncontractually specified servicing fees, prepayment \\nassumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late \\ncharges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic \\nfactors.

In addition, unless \\ncollateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations, \\ncovered transactions are generally limited to 10% of the \\nbanking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk-\\nbased capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered \\ntransactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its \\naffiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total \\ncapital.\\nThe Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are \\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings \\nLLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC \\ngenerally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries \\nother than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. \\nThe IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany \\nloans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is \\nobligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net \\nproceeds received from securities issuances (including \\nissuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of \\npreferred and common stock).\\nThe principal sources of income and funding for the Parent \\nCompany are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. \\nand dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In \\naddition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and \\nregulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have \\nauthority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to \\nprohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking \\norganizations they supervise, including the Parent Company \\nand its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding \\ncompanies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment \\nof a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound \\npractice in light of the financial condition of the banking \\norganization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or \\nextending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or \\nliquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise \\nimposed by the Parent Company’s management or Board of \\nDirectors.\\nAt January 1, 2024, the Parent Company’s banking \\nsubsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $20 \\nbillion in dividends to their respective bank holding \\ncompanies without the prior approval of their relevant \\nbanking regulators.

U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that \\ncontingently requires the guarantor to pa\\ny the guaranteed \\nparty based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, \\nliability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a \\nthird party’s failure to perform under a specified \\nagreement.\\n The Firm considers the following off–balance \\nsheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: \\nstandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, \\nsecurities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification \\nagreements included within third-party contractual \\narrangements, certain derivative contracts and the \\nguarantees under the sponsored member repo program.\\n \\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records \\nguarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-\\ncontingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of \\nconsideration received or the net present value of the \\npremium receivable). For these obligations, \\nthe Firm \\nrecords this fair value amount in other liabilities with an \\noffsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), \\nor other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium \\nreceivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is \\nreceived under the contract, and the fair value of the \\nliability recorded at inception is amortized into income as \\nlending and deposit-related fees over the life of the \\nguarantee contract. The lending-related contingent \\nobligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in \\naddition to, and separate from, any non-contingent \\nobligation.\\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized \\nwhen the liability becomes probable and reasonably \\nestimable.

As part of this \\nprogram, the Firm provides an indemnification in the \\nlending agreements which protects the lender against the \\nfailure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To \\nminimize its liability under these indemnification \\nagreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid \\ncollateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value \\nof the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is \\nmarked to market daily to help assure that collateralization \\nis adequate. Additional collateral is called from the \\nborrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released \\nto the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a \\nborrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to \\npurchase replacement securities in the market or to credit \\nthe lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent \\nthereof. \\nThe cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on \\nbehalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements, \\nwhereby the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of \\nprincipal invested. To minimize its liability under these \\nagreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value \\nexceeding 100% of the principal invested.\\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees \\nThe Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have \\nthe characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These \\ncontracts include written put options that require the Firm \\nto purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a \\nspecified price by a specified date in the future. The Firm \\nmay enter into written put option contracts in order to meet \\nclient needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of \\nwritten put options are typically five years or less. \\nDerivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable \\nvalue contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value \\nproducts”, that require the Firm to make a payment of the \\ndifference between the market value and the book value of \\na counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event \\nthat market value is less than book value and certain other \\nconditions have been met. Stable value products are \\ntransacted in order to allow investors to realize investment \\nreturns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. \\nThese contracts are typically longer-term or may have no \\nstated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the \\ncontract under certain conditions. \\nThe notional value of derivative guarantees generally \\nrepresents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, \\nexposure to certain stable value products is contractually \\nlimited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional \\namount. \\nThe fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the \\nprobability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will be \\nrequired to perform under the contract. The Firm reduces \\nexposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting \\ntransactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the \\nmarket risk related to the derivative guarantees. \\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying \\nas guarantees as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\\n(in millions)\\nDecember 31, \\n2023\\nDecember 31, \\n2022\\nNotional amounts\\nDerivative guarantees $ 54,562 $ 59,180 \\nStable value contracts with \\ncontractually limited exposure  32,488  31,820 \\nMaximum exposure of stable \\nvalue contracts with \\ncontractually limited exposure  1,652  2,063 \\nFair value\\nDerivative payables  89  649 \\nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the \\ncharacteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser \\nand seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives \\nmarket.

At settlement, these \\ncommitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and \\nreceiving securities collateral from the counterparty. The \\nFirm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned \\nagreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the \\nFirm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral \\nto the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future \\ndate. These agreements generally do not meet the \\ndefinition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded \\non the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. \\nThese agreements predominantly have regular-way \\nsettlement terms.

The terms of the securities \\nmay also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if \\nsuch additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also \\nenter into indemnification clauses in connection with the \\nlicensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or \\nwhen it sells a business or assets to a third party (“third-\\nparty purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies \\nsoftware licensees for claims of liability or damages that \\nmay occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or \\nthird-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to \\nactions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or \\nassets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum \\nexposure under these indemnification arrangements, since \\nthis would require an assessment of future changes in tax \\nlaw and future claims that may be made against the Firm \\nthat have not yet occurred. However, based on historical \\nexperience, management expects the risk of loss to be \\nremote. \\nMerchant charge-backs  \\nUnder the rules of payment networks, in its role as a \\nmerchant acquirer, the Firm’s Merchant Services business \\nin CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed \\nprocessed credit and debit card transactions that result in a \\ncharge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the \\ncardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s \\nissuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder \\nand will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the \\nFirm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the \\nFirm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded \\nto the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by \\nwithholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve \\naccounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm \\nrecognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment \\nor performance risk related to charge-backs. \\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, \\nthe Firm processed an aggregate volume of $2,411.0 \\nbillion, $2,158.4 billion, and $1,886.7 billion, respectively.\\nClearing Services – Client Credit Risk \\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering \\ninto securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts \\nwith CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as \\nwell as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing \\nmember, the Firm stands behind the performance of its \\nclients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as \\nwell as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and \\nremits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. \\nThere are two types of margin: variation margin is posted \\non a daily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative \\ncontracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a \\nderivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential \\nchanges in the variation margin requirement for the \\ncontract. \\nAs a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of \\nnonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for \\nthe performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm \\nseeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection \\nof appropriate amounts of margin at inception and \\nthroughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also \\ncease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to \\ntheir obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event \\nof nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the \\nclient’s positions and access available margin. The CCP \\nwould utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with \\nany remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as \\na clearing member. \\nThe Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the \\nclient through the recognition of margin receivables from \\nclients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying \\nsecurities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the \\nFirm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. \\nIt is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible \\nexposure through its role as a clearing member, as this \\nwould require an assessment of transactions that clients \\nmay execute in the future. However, based upon historical \\nexperience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the \\nFirm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will \\nhave to make any material payments under these \\narrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote. \\nRefer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the \\nFirm executes for its own account and records in its \\nConsolidated Financial Statements. \\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 295'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 333, 'page_label': '296'}, page_content='Exchange & Clearing House Memberships \\nThe Firm is a member of several securities and derivative \\nexchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other \\ncountries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. \\nMembership in some of these organizations requires the \\nFirm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the \\norganization as a result of the default of another member. \\nSuch obligations vary with different organizations.

In \\nIsrael, a settlement in principle has been reached on the \\nputative class action, which remains subject to court \\napproval. \\nGovernment Inquiries Related to the Zelle Network. The Firm \\nis responding to inquiries from civil government authorities \\nregarding the handling of disputes related to transfers of \\nfunds through the Zelle Network. The Firm is cooperating \\nwith these inquiries and responding to requests for \\ninformation.\\nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail \\nassociations filed a series of class action complaints alleging \\nthat Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, \\nconspired to set the price of credit and debit card \\ninterchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of \\nantitrust laws.\\nIn September 2018, the parties settled the class action \\nseeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively \\ncontributing approximately $6.2 billion. The settlement has \\nbeen approved by the District Court and affirmed on appeal. \\nBased on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the \\nsettlement, $700 million has been returned to the \\ndefendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class \\naction seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September \\n2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class \\ncertification in part, and denied the motion in part.\\nOf the merchants who opted out of the damages class \\nsettlement, certain merchants filed individual actions \\nraising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as \\nwell as against the Firm and other banks. While some of \\nthose actions remain pending, the defendants have reached \\nsettlements with the merchants who opted out representing \\napproximately 70% of the combined Mastercard-branded \\nand Visa-branded payment card sales volume. \\nJeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was \\nnamed as a defendant in lawsuits filed in the United States \\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York alleging \\nthat JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated \\nJeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct \\nby providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. In June \\n2023, the Court granted preliminary approval of a \\nsettlement between the victim class and JPMorgan Chase \\nBank, N.A., pursuant to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. \\npaid $290 million to a fund for Epstein survivors. In \\nNovember 2023, the Court granted final approval of the \\nsettlement, rejecting objections, including those of certain \\nstate Attorneys General, regarding the victims’ releases. \\nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and \\nLitigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from \\nvarious governmental agencies and entities around the \\nworld relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s \\n(“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for \\nvarious currencies and the European Banking Federation’s \\nEuro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss \\nCompetition Commission’s investigation relating to \\nEURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain \\nsubject, continues. The Firm appealed a December 2016 \\ndecision by the European Commission against the Firm and \\nother banks finding an infringement of European antitrust \\nrules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European \\nGeneral Court annulled the fine imposed by the European \\nCommission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine \\nin an identical amount. The Firm is considering its options.  \\nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along \\nwith other banks in various individual and putative class \\nactions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar \\nLIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the \\nperiod that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has \\nobtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain \\nother actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. \\nThe United States District Court for the Southern District of \\nNew York has granted class certification of antitrust claims \\nrelated to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the \\ndefendants, including the Firm. In addition, a lawsuit filed \\nby a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, \\nalleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged \\nin an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and \\nconspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based \\nconsumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October \\n2023. Plaintiff filed an appeal of the dismissal to the United \\nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in November \\n2023. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR \\nactions.\\nRussian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with \\ninternational sanctions laws, which mandate the freezing or \\nrestriction of certain assets. These laws apply when assets \\nassociated with individuals, companies, products or services \\nare within the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced \\nactual and threatened litigation in Russia seeking payments \\non transactions that the Firm cannot make, and is \\ncontractually excused from paying, under relevant \\nsanctions laws, with judgment entered against the Firm in \\none claim in February 2024.

Separately, the Firm is responding to \\nrequests from the SEC in connection with the timing of the \\nFirm’s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain \\ninvestment vehicles that invest in third-party managed \\nprivate funds. The Firm is cooperating with the SEC in \\nregard to both inquires.\\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase \\nBank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, \\nInc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are \\nnamed as defendants in a putative class action filed in the \\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New \\nYork. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust \\nlaw and New York State common law in connection with an \\nalleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous \\nexchange trading for securities lending transactions. The \\nsettlement of this action by the parties has been \\npreliminarily approved, and is subject to final court \\napproval.\\nShareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative class \\nactions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting \\nto act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the \\nFirm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and \\nformer officers.  \\nCertain of these shareholder suits relate to historical \\ntrading practices by former employees in the precious \\nmetals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct \\nwhich were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the \\nDOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary \\nactivities that were separately the subject of a resolution \\nbetween JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in \\nNovember 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits \\nwas filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in \\nMay 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust \\nenrichment claims relating to the historical trading \\npractices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which \\nwere the subject of the resolutions described above. In \\nDecember 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to \\ndismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the plaintiff \\nfiled an appeal, which remains pending. A second \\nshareholder derivative action was filed in the United States \\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York in \\nDecember 2022 relating to the historical trading practices \\nand related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty \\nand contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is \\nexcused from making a demand to commence litigation \\nbecause such a demand would have been futile. Defendants \\nhave moved to dismiss the complaint. In addition, a \\nconsolidated putative class action is pending in the United \\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of New York on \\nbehalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan \\nChase common stock during the putative class period, \\nalleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially \\nfalse or misleading because they did not disclose certain \\ninformation relating to the historical trading practices and \\nconduct. In December 2023, the court granted Defendants’ \\nmotion to dismiss the amended complaint.\\nA shareholder derivative suit was filed in May 2023 in the \\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New \\nYork against various officers and directors of the Firm \\nasserting breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment \\nbased upon allegations that the defendants caused the Firm \\nto retain Jeffrey Epstein as a client of the bank after \\ndefendants knew, or should have known, that Epstein was \\nusing the Firm’s financial services to facilitate his alleged \\nsex trafficking activities. In December 2023, the Court \\ndismissed the derivative action.\\nA separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March \\n2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern \\nDistrict of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty \\nand violations of federal securities laws based on the \\nalleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise \\nadequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records \\npreservation requirements which were the subject of \\nresolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and \\nthe SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the \\namended complaint is pending.\\nTrading Venues Investigations. The Firm has been \\nresponding to government inquiries regarding its processes \\nto inventory trading venues and confirm the completeness \\nof certain data fed to trade surveillance platforms. The Firm \\nself-identified that certain trading and order data through \\nthe CIB was not feeding into its trade surveillance \\nplatforms. The Firm has completed enhancements to the \\nCIB’s venue inventory and data completeness controls, and \\nother remediation is underway. The Firm has also \\nperformed a review of the data not originally surveilled, \\nwhich is nearly complete, and has not identified any \\nemployee misconduct, harm to clients or the market. While \\nthe identified gaps represent a fraction of the overall \\nactivity across the CIB, the data gap on one venue, which \\nlargely consisted of sponsored client access activity, was \\nsignificant. The Firm is dedicated to maintaining rigorous \\ncontrols and continuously enhancing the reliability of its \\ntrade infrastructure. The Firm expects to enter into \\nresolutions with two U.S. regulators that will require the \\nFirm to, among other things, complete its remediation, \\nengage an independent consultant, and pay aggregate civil \\npenalties of approximately $350 million. The Firm is also in \\nadvanced negotiations with a third U.S. regulator, but there \\nis no assurance that such discussions will result in a \\nresolution. The Firm does not expect any disruption of \\nservice to clients as a result of these resolutions.\\n*     *     *\\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\\n300 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 338, 'page_label': '301'}, page_content='In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed \\nabove, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as \\ndefendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial \\nnumber of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has \\nmeritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its \\ncurrently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to \\ndefend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may \\nbe initiated from time to time in the future.\\nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its \\ncurrently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with \\nthe provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm \\naccrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable \\nthat such a liability has been incurred and the amount of \\nthe loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its \\noutstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its \\nlitigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, \\nupward or downward, as appropriate, based on \\nmanagement’s best judgment after consultation with \\ncounsel.

The Firm notes, however, that in light of the \\nuncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no \\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will \\nnot significantly exceed the reserves it has currently \\naccrued or that a matter will not have material reputational \\nconsequences.

The Firm \\nbelieves that the First Republic acquisition is \\ncomplementary to the Firm\\'s existing franchises. The \\nacquisition resulted in an estimated bargain purchase gain, \\nwhich represents the excess of the estimated fair value of \\nthe net assets acquired above the purchase price. \\nThe Firm has determined that this acquisition constitutes a \\nbusiness combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the \\ninitial recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities \\nassumed were generally measured at their estimated fair \\nvalues as of May 1, 2023. The determination of those fair \\nvalues required management to make certain market-based \\nassumptions about expected future cash flows, discount \\nrates and other valuation inputs at the time of the \\nacquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value estimates \\nof the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a \\nreasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain \\npurchase gain. \\nThe Firm and the FDIC have not yet completed the \\nsettlement process under which the purchase price, and the \\nidentification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, \\nwill be finalized. The finalization of this settlement process \\nmay impact the amount of the estimated bargain purchase \\ngain. The purchase and assumption agreement entered into \\nwith the FDIC allows for final settlement to occur up to a \\nyear after the acquisition date. \\nIn addition, the purchase price and the estimated bargain \\npurchase gain could change pending management\\'s \\nfinalization of its acquisition date fair value estimates for \\ncertain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which \\nmay take place up to one year from the acquisition date, as \\npermitted by U.S. GAAP.\\nThe First Republic acquisition resulted in a preliminary \\nestimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion. The Firm \\nhas continued to progress in the settlement process with \\nthe FDIC and refine its acquisition-date fair value estimates. \\nAs a result, during the year ended December 31, 2023, \\nadjustments totaling $63 million were made, increasing the \\nestimated bargain purchase gain to $2.8 billion.\\nIn connection with the First Republic acquisition, the Firm \\nand the FDIC entered into two shared-loss agreements with \\nrespect to certain loans and lending-related commitments \\n(the \"shared-loss assets\"): the Commercial Shared-Loss \\nAgreement (\"CSLA\") and the Single-Family Shared-Loss \\nAgreement (“SFSLA”). The CSLA covers 80% of credit \\nlosses, on a pari passu basis, over 5 years with a \\nsubsequent 3-year recovery period for certain acquired \\ncommercial loans and other real estate exposure. The \\nSFSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu basis, \\nfor 7 years for certain acquired loans secured by mortgages \\non real property or shares in cooperative property \\nconstituting a primary residence. The indemnification \\nassets, which represent the fair value of the CSLA and \\nSFSLA on the acquisition date, are reflected in the total \\nassets acquired.\\nAs part of the consideration paid, JPMorgan Chase issued a \\nfive-year, $50 billion secured note to the FDIC (the \\n\"Purchase Money Note\"). The Purchase Money Note bears \\ninterest at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is secured by certain of \\nthe acquired loans. The Purchase Money Note is prepayable \\nupon notice to the holder.\\nThe Firm had placed a $5 billion deposit with First Republic \\nBank on March 16, 2023, as part of $30 billion of deposits \\nprovided by a consortium of large U.S. banks. The Firm\\'s $5 \\nbillion deposit was effectively settled as part of the \\nacquisition and the associated allowance for credit losses \\nwas released upon closing. The Firm subsequently repaid \\nthe remaining $25 billion of deposits to the consortium of \\nbanks, including accrued interest through the payment date \\non May 9, 2023.\\n \\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K 307'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 345, 'page_label': '308'}, page_content=\"The computation of the purchase price, the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the \\nFirst Republic acquisition and the related estimated bargain purchase gain are presented below, and reflect the adjustments \\nmade through December 31, 2023 to the acquisition-date fair value of the net assets acquired.\\nFair value purchase\\nprice allocation as of\\nMay 1, 2023(in millions)\\nPurchase price consideration\\nAmounts paid/due to the FDIC, net of cash acquired(a) $ 13,524 \\nPurchase Money Note (at fair value)  48,848 \\nSettlement of First Republic deposit and other related party transactions(b)  5,447 \\nContingent consideration - Shared-loss agreements  15 \\nPurchase price consideration $ 67,834 \\nAssets \\nSecurities $ 30,285 \\nLoans(c)  153,242 \\nCore deposit and customer relationship intangibles  1,455 \\nIndemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements  675 \\nAccounts receivable and other assets(c)(d)  6,574 \\nTotal assets acquired $ 192,231 \\nLiabilities\\nDeposits $ 87,572 \\nFHLB advances  27,919 \\nLending-related commitments  2,614 \\nAccounts payable and other liabilities(c)(d)  2,793 \\nDeferred tax liabilities  724 \\nTotal liabilities assumed $ 121,622 \\nFair value of net assets acquired $ 70,609 \\nEstimated gain on acquisition, after-tax $ 2,775 \\n(a) Includes $10.6 billion of cash paid to the FDIC at acquisition and $3.6 billion payable to the FDIC, less cash acquired of $680 million.\\n(b) Includes $447 million of securities financing transactions with First Republic Bank that were effectively settled on the acquisition date.\\n(c) In the fourth quarter, certain assets and liabilities were reclassified resulting in a $762 million increase to loans, an $870 million decrease to accounts \\nreceivable and other assets and a $30 million increase to accounts payable and other liabilities.\\n(d) Other assets include $1.2 billion in tax-oriented investments and $683 million of lease right-of-use assets.

The after-tax cost \\nsavings were estimated based on the difference between \\nthe cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the \\ncost of next best alternative funding sources available to \\nmarket participants. The customer relationship intangibles \\nof $180 million were valued by discounting estimated after-\\ntax earnings over their remaining useful lives using the \\nmulti-period excess earnings method.

As a result, changes in \\nthe granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities \\ninvolved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.\\n2023 versus 2022 2022 versus 2021\\n(Unaudited)\\nIncrease/(decrease) due \\nto change in:\\nIncrease/(decrease) due \\nto change in:\\nYear ended December 31,\\n(On a taxable-equivalent basis; in millions) Volume Rate\\nNet\\nchange Volume Rate\\nNet\\nchange\\nInterest-earning assets\\nDeposits with banks:\\nU.S. $ (8,225) $ 16,155 $ 7,930 $ (1,185) $ 7,910 $ 6,725 \\nNon-U.S.  (361)  5,189  4,828  166  1,636  1,802 \\nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale \\nagreements:\\nU.S.  1,347  4,792  6,139  267  1,625  1,892 \\nNon-U.S.  (629)  4,937  4,308  311  1,471  1,782 \\nSecurities borrowed:\\nU.S.  (411)  4,839  4,428  64  2,066  2,130 \\nNon-U.S.  (95)  1,413  1,318  69  423  492 \\nTrading assets – debt instruments:\\nU.S.  3,358  1,949  5,307  375  1,509  1,884 \\nNon-U.S.  666  931  1,597  (418)  775  357 \\nInvestment securities:\\nU.S.  (1,690)  8,165  6,475  1,061  2,534  3,595 \\nNon-U.S.  228  651  879  (2)  207  205 \\nLoans:  \\nU.S.  10,296  17,635  27,931  2,988  6,750  9,738 \\nNon-U.S.  (258)  3,039  2,781  148  1,328  1,476 \\nAll other interest-earning assets, predominantly U.S.  (3,749)  7,655  3,906  161  2,708  2,869 \\nChange in interest income  477  77,350  77,827  4,005  30,942  34,947 \\nInterest-bearing liabilities\\nInterest-bearing deposits:\\nU.S.  (1,284)  20,511  19,227  268  5,857  6,125 \\nNon-U.S.  597  10,110  10,707  161  3,265  3,426 \\nFederal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under \\nrepurchase agreements:\\nU.S.  1,293  6,263  7,556  (466)  3,327  2,861 \\nNon-U.S.  (480)  2,462  1,982  93  493  586 \\nTrading liabilities – debt, short-term and all other interest-bearing \\nliabilities:\\nU.S.  409  4,981 \\n 5,390  206  2,523  2,729 \\nNon-U.S.  (17)  1,924  1,907  125  756  881 \\nBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs, predominantly \\nU.S.  381  346  727  (69)  212  143 \\nLong-term debt:\\nU.S.  2,494  5,229  7,723  75  3,722  3,797 \\nNon-U.S.  (3)  8  5  (31)  27  (4) \\nChange in interest expense  3,390  51,834  55,224  362  20,182  20,544 \\nChange in net interest income $ (2,913) $ 25,516 $ 22,603 $ 3,643 $ 10,760 $ 14,403 \\n \\nChanges in net interest income, volume and rate analysis\\n314 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\\n2023 versus 2022 2022 versus 20212023 versus 2022 2022 versus 2021\\nIncrease/(decrease) due \\nto change in:\\nIncrease/(decrease) due \\nto change in:'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 2020 20 Paper Capture Plug-in', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2024-03-27T20:21:55+00:00', 'author': 'JP Morgan Chase & Co.', 'keywords': 'Powering; Growth; with; Curiosity; and; Heart; Annual; Report; 2023; JP; Morgan; Chase; &; Co', 'moddate': '2024-09-23T08:04:47-04:00', 'subject': 'Annual Report 2023', 'title': 'Powering Growth with Curiosity and Heart Annual Report 2023', 'source': '/content/annualreport-2023.pdf', 'total_pages': 364, 'page': 352, 'page_label': '315'}, page_content='2022 Form 10-K: Annual report on Form 10-K for the year \\nended December 31, 2022, filed with the U.S. Securities \\nand Exchange Commission. \\nABS: Asset-backed securities \\nAFS: Available-for-sale \\nALCO: Asset Liability Committee\\nAmortized cost: Amount at which a financing receivable or \\ninvestment is originated or acquired, adjusted for accretion \\nor amortization of premium, discount, and net deferred fees \\nor costs, collection of cash, charge-offs, foreign exchange, \\nand fair value hedge accounting adjustments.

The fully indexed \\nrate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once \\nthe introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate \\ncharged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and \\nadjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The \\nminimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest \\naccrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is \\ndeferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. \\nOption ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which \\nconverts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan \\nupon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date \\ntriggers. \\nPrime \\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good \\ncredit records who meet specific underwriting \\nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements related \\nto income and overall debt levels.
