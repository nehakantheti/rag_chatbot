INFO:root:Session ID : 428cbadc-cfe8-4702-a1a0-e2e49d81bab6, AI Response : According to the text, some malware techniques include:

*   **Polymorphism:** Changing the malware's code to avoid signature-based detection.
*   **Code Obfuscation:** Making the code difficult to understand to evade analysis.
*   **Encryption:** Encrypting parts of the malware to hide its malicious intent.
*   **Fileless execution:** Operating without writing files to disk, making detection harder.
*   **Zero-day exploits:** Taking advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities.

INFO:root:Session ID : 428cbadc-cfe8-4702-a1a0-e2e49d81bab6, AI Response : Deep learning (DL) approaches are gaining traction in malware detection because traditional methods struggle with new and unseen malware. DL models can learn directly from data and generalize to novel inputs, making them more effective against evolving threats.

Here's a bit more about DL in malware detection, based on the provided context and cited papers:

*   **System Call Sequences:** DL can be used to classify malware based on the sequences of system calls they make (Kolosnjaji et al., 2017).
*   **Process Behavior:** DL models can analyze process behavior to detect malware (Tobiyama et al., 2016).
*   **Automatic Signature Generation:** DL can automatically generate malware signatures and classify malware (David and Netanyahu, 2015).
*   **Hybrid Approaches:** Combining DL models like CNNs with other machine learning techniques like SVMs can improve malware detection (Kumar et al., 2021).
